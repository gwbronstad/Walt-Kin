<h3>Josephine's story as told by her youngest daughter, Grace</h3><p> &nbsp;  "Her father and two brothers went away to war and she never saw them again. Their home [near Rome, GA.] along with their barns, orchards, chickens were destroyed by the north [Gen. Sherman's provisioners?]. Her two little sisters became ill with measles and died from lack of medicine, food and warmth.

<p>My mother [Josephine] was given, or put into the hands of a good friend to care for her children as she was moving to Kansas to find work --her husband had been killed in the war. When they reached Kansas City, she [Josephine] took measles then pneumonia, and was very ill almost losing her eyesight.

<p>The friend that took her was unable to locate her mother for several years, and mama later married a man [Augustus H Berger] much older than she; they had two little girls - one died and later her husband died. It was later she married my father [James Monroe Embrey]."

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Papa was from Mississippi; according to mama his family were more moneyed people than hers. He loved to dance- and often danced all night followed by lovely breakfast for all the young people. His family was a large one but he didn't even carry in a stick of wood until after the war. THE slave's homes were burned the same as theirs. They were without a place to live or any food and they all came back to my grandfather for help.

<p>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Papa was in the cavalry in the war and they often had nothing to eat but crackers, and they some times had to knock the worms off these. They often sat on their horses or used their saddles for pillows as they lay on the ground, and much of the time it was raining. He came to Texas alone most of the way riding horseback. He bought land in Hamilton. I would not quote the price for sure because I am not sure anyway, about the price and no one could believe it anyway. He experienced some very frightening experiences on that trip to Texas. He and some of his brothers hauled lumber from Waco by wagon, taking several days for one trip-- to build one little house on a hill top close to the road between Hamilton and Pottsville. Later there were other small houses done on the ranch near Bear Creek--moving closer to town each time they were built-- Later a larger house - only two miles from Hamilton- where I was born. It seems that all of we children attended Hamilton school, and that every year someone was graduated, and papa always took us for the exercises, and it always came a big rain, usually a wind, rain and hail storm, and when we got home we found mama in the storm house. What has become of those wonderful rains?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"I have many memories of my childhood days –some very sad, some happy, and some very beautiful. One that is outstanding is the evening after supper we spent in the yard-- papa had a special cane bottomed chair that he liked to rest in, he propped it against the house – close to the step where I sat. My older sister, Jessie went to the piano, set the lamp on the piano, and played the most beautiful music ever heard in the valley. --like Rock of Ages and the variations “Over the Waves” and on and on. Mama always went to bed early to be rested for the next day’s work, but she listened to us all. Papa pointed out the important stars in the heavens as the Big Dipper, North Star and so on. The moon came up just beyond the curve of a big oak tree a short way from where we sat.</p>

<p>"All grew quieter and quieter while my sister played on and on. Papa loved music and horses – the outdoors and politics. He often rode over the country visiting with other ranchers. – sheep ranchers- that is-- He drove old Mollie-- she was getting too fat and needed the exercise, so he’d say—and he would also take me with him-- such an unforgettable experience--

</figure>
<p>as we lazed along most of the day—me holding the lines for Old Mollie while he and the fellows discussed politics with as much concern as we all do today and it seems like Papa was usually the chairman and gave out information on John Bull and the Big Bear.  Papa read as much as he could find time for; always it was nonfiction and news. I never remember when a Dallas News was not in our mail box—giving all current news.
