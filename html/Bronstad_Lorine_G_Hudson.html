<h2><img class="sp" src="../pic/Pinky/Gulbrand-pinky.jpg" alt="Gulbrand pic">G. O. Bronstad Bosque Pioneer, Passes Away.</h2>
<p>G. O. Bronstad, pioneer Bosque County citizen, died at his home at Cranfills Gap, Sunday, July 19, 1937, at about 1:45 p. m. Funeral services were conducted Monday afternoon at the St. Olaf Lutheran Church with interment in the St. Olaf Cemetery.</p>
<p>Mr. Bronstad was born March 9, 1856, in Romedal, Hedemarken, Norway. In 1874, at the age of 18, he emigrated to the United States, coming direct to Bosque County, Texas, where he joined his brother, C. O., at Valley Mills. Here in Bosque County he at once made his home and in due time adopted this country as his own. During his long life he has been an active and contributing citizen.</p>
<p>From 1874 to 1886 he lived successively at Valley Mills, Norway Mills and Morgan, engaging in business and learning merchandising. In 1886 he moved to Cranfills Gap, and opened his business concern in Cranfills Gap. Thus Mr. Bronstad successfully rounded out more than fifty years in business in this one location.</p>
<p>
In the land of his nativity he was baptized, and after proper training, was confirmed in the Lutheran Church. To this faith, confessed early in life, he remained true to the end.</p>
<p>This now departed highly respected citizen, lived a quiet, unassuming life, sincere in spirit, sympathetic, generous, and cheerful. In spite of severe experiences in business, he remained of sympathetic and kindly nature, giving service to his friends from far and near. All men were greeted with a smile in the Bronstad Store.</p>
<p>Due to the absence of his pastor, Rev. W. J. Maakestad, Rev. P. E. Thorson of Norse conducted the funeral services, assisted by Rev. O. T. Boe of Clifton and Rev. Farmer, Cranfills Gap. Inspiring music was furnished by St. Olaf Male Quartet, and by Mrs. Troll and Miss Knudson in a vocal duet.</p>
<p>Beside his wife, he leaves six children, Otis, Clyde, and Homer, Margaret, Mrs. C. L. Rohne and Mrs. <b>Douglas Hudson</b>. These all reside at Cranfills Gap except Mrs. Hudson, who lives in Holdenville, Okla. He is also survived by one brother, Otto, of Waco, and three sisters, Carrie and Syverine Bronstad of Waco, and Mrs Pernella Anderson, Clifton.</p>
<p>The large gathering of sorrowing friends and relatives that overflowed the spacious church was something of an indication of the high esteem in which Mr. Bronstad was held. Representatives from every section of Bosque County, from Hamilton and Coryell Counties, came to pay tribute to a good friend, a christian gentleman, an high-class merchant, a man.

<h4>1950-04-28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. G. O. Bronstad Dies At Cranfills Gap</h4>
<p> Mrs. Laura Wilhelmina Hanson[sic] Bronstad was born of parents Hans Jergen and Petra Hanson[sic] December 11, 1873, at the old family homestead about four miles East of Cranfills Gap. She was baptized in infancy by the Rev. J. K. Rystad in Our Saviour's Lutheran Church at Norse. She was confirmed in the Lutheran faith by the same pastor and in the same church on June 23, 1889. On November 30, 1893, she was united in marriage to G. O. Bronstad at the old Rock Church near the old Hanson[sic] home. To this union were born six children, three sons, Otis and Clyde of Cranfills Gap, and Homer of Vernon; three daughters, Marie, Mrs. Chris Rohne, and Marguerite, both of Cranfills Gap, and Lorine, Mrs <b>Douglas Hudson</b>, of Holdenville, Oklahoma. Besides the above children she is survived by thirteen grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.</p>
<p>She is survived by four sisters, namely Mathilda, Mrs. Thomas Jenson, Celia, Mrs. Emil Erickson, Martha, Mrs. Newman Hastings, and Mrs. Jennie Jermstad. She was preceded in death by her husband on July 18, 1937. Her only brother, Ferdie Hanson, died on June 12, 1942. Her oldest sister, Mary Gaustad, also preceded her in death May 21, 1949.</p>
<p>Grandmother Bronstad, as she became affectionately known in her family circle, passed away peacefully in her Cranfills Gap home, where she had lived for 57 years, at about 7:00 a.m. April 24, 1950, at the age of 76 years, 4 months and 13 days.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bronstad lived a life of deep Christian conviction and devotion to her church. She lived a life of complete surrender to her Saviour. She was sure in her faith and true to her Lord. In this assurance she lived a joyful life. The unselfish love for her family and friends will long be remembered. May god bless her memory.</p>
<p>Funeral services were held at the Bronstad home in Cranfills Gap, Tuesday, April 25, at 2:00 p.m. and at St. Olaf Lutheran Church at 2:30 p.m., with the pastor, Rev. B. R. Maakestad, in charge.
