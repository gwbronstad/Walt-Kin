<h4>1950-04-28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. G. O. Bronstad Dies At Cranfills Gap</h4>
<p> Mrs. Laura Wilhelmina Hanson[sic] Bronstad was born of parents Hans Jergen and Petra Hanson[sic] December 11, 1873, at the old family homestead about four miles East of Cranfills Gap. She was baptized in infancy by the Rev. J. K. Rystad in Our Saviour's Lutheran Church at Norse. She was confirmed in the Lutheran faith by the same pastor and in the same church on June 23, 1889. On November 30, 1893, she was united in marriage to G. O. Bronstad at the old Rock Church near the old Hanson[sic] home. To this union were born six children, three sons, Otis and Clyde of Cranfills Gap, and Homer of Vernon; three daughters, Marie, Mrs. Chris Rohne, and Marguerite, both of Cranfills Gap, and Lorine, Mrs Douglas Hudson, of Holdenville, Oklahoma. Besides the above children she is survived by thirteen grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.</p>
<p>She is survived by four sisters, namely Mathilda, Mrs. Thomas Jenson, Celia, Mrs. Emil Erickson, Martha, Mrs. Newman Hastings, and Mrs. Jennie Jermstad. She was preceded in death by her husband on July 18, 1937. Her only brother, Ferdie Hanson, died on June 12, 1942. Her oldest sister, Mary Gaustad, also preceded her in death May 21, 1949.</p>
<p>Grandmother Bronstad, as she became affectionately known in her family circle, passed away peacefully in her Cranfills Gap home, where she had lived for 57 years, at about 7:00 a.m. April 24, 1950, at the age of 76 years, 4 months and 13 days.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bronstad lived a life of deep Christian conviction and devotion to her church. She lived a life of complete surrender to her Saviour. She was sure in her faith and true to her Lord. In this assurance she lived a joyful life. The unselfish love for her family and friends will long be remembered. May god bless her memory.</p>
<p>Funeral services were held at the Bronstad home in Cranfills Gap, Tuesday, April 25, at 2:00 p.m. and at St. Olaf Lutheran Church at 2:30 p.m., with the pastor, Rev. B. R. Maakestad, in charge. The audience sang the hymn "Jesus Priceless Treasure" and the ladies' Chorus of the church sang, "I'm But a Strange Here" and "I Know of a Sleep In Jesus Name."</p>
