<h4>Vestre Toten</h4> is a municipality in Innlandet county, Norway. It is located in the traditional district of Toten. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Raufoss. Other villages in the municipality include Bøverbru, Eina, and Reinsvoll.[4]
<br><br>
The 251-square-kilometre (97 sq mi) municipality is the 287th largest by area out of the 356 municipalities in Norway. Vestre Toten is the 88th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 13,635. The municipality's population density is 58.7 inhabitants per square kilometre (152/sq mi) and its population has increased by 4.9% over the previous 10-year period.[5][6]
General information
<br><br>
Vestre Toten was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). On 1 January 1875, there was a border adjustment between Østre Toten Municipality and Vestre Toten Municipality. On 1 January 1908, the municipality was divided into three parts: Kolbu Municipality (population: 2,412) in the southeast, Eina Municipality (population: 1,173) in the southwest, and Vestre Toten Municipality (population: 4,027) in the north. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the following areas were merged to form a new, larger Vestre Toten Municipality:[7]
<ul>
<li>all of the old Vestre Toten Municipality (population: 9,113)</li>
<li>the Sørligrenda area of Vardal Municipality (population: 87)</li>
<li>all of the old Eina Municipality (population: 1,591)</li>
<li>the area on the south end of the lake Einavatnet from Gran</li>
<li>Municipality (population: 12)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Name</h4>
The municipality is named Vestre Toten after the district of Toten (Old Norse: Þótn). The name is identical with the word Þótn which has an uncertain meaning, but it might be from the word þóttr which means "the pleasant district" or "something one likes". The parish of Toten was divided into two parts (eastern and western) in 1825 and the first word, vestre was added to signify that this was the "western" part, thus the name was Vestre Toten which means "(the) western (part of) Toten".

<blockquote>Exerpts from "Four Mile" by Martin T. Jenson, to celebrate the 125 anniversary of Four Mile church in 1972.Included in the book are letters to Reverend Jenson from V.A. Mohr, Southern District of the American Lutheran Church, Austin, TX; Kent S. Knutson, The American Lutheran Church, Minneapolis, Minnesota; Arne Gunneng, Ambassador of Norway; Lyndon B. Johnson, former President of the United States, Austin, Texas and Richard Nixon, President of the United States.<br><br>
Pastor Jenson writes: 
"Take for example the Johan Foss family.They came in 1852.He was killed by a rattlesnake in 1853.His widow and two of her three children stayed at Four Mile till 1872 or 1873.When the Foss descendants came together for their first reunion at Four Mile Church in 1967, there were over two hundred living members of the tribe throughout the United States and Canada, all claiming allegiance to some Christian Church.these included pastors, doctors, nurses, teachers, lawyers, farmers, scientists, pharmacists, secretaries, missionaries and almost every one of the more common profession of our time."

<h4>1899-11-17 {Groom Index}</h4>
<p class="red-yel-grn"> Jermstad, Charlie G wed Jennie Hanson, book G page 249 </p>
<blockquote class="gwb"> Jennie Hanson was Laura (Hansen) Bronstad's youngest sister. The Clifton record, and other records gives us glimpses into the man Jennie wed, Charles Gustave Jermstad (1879-11-23 - 1933-08-08). He seemed to embrace many large, radical changes in his life; some will be noted here as the record unfolds. Jenny's life looked unusually stress filled.<br><br>
Well before her death in 1950, Laura had asked her second son, Clyde, my Father, to look in on Jennie when he could. In about 1952, Clyde took me on one of his visits with Jennie. Jennie was employed as a housekeeper for one of the men who resided on the grounds of the Fort Worth oil refinery near the corner of 28<sup>th</sup> Street and Sylvania. 
<br><br>
Jennie welcomed us with spice cake with butter creme icing. This 12 year old found it wonderful; a food experience never repeated, though my girth affirms I have not failed for lack of trying.
<br><br>
Wholly without credentials in the issue, I have inferred Charley was troubled with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder" target="_blank">Bipolar disorder.</a> That his emotional life was a whipsaw of ups and downs. 
<br><br>
There is no remote wish to condemn, but rather to understand and sympathize. <p class="red-yel-grn">There is a thread to this argument, it is illuminated thus: with a green-yellow-red gradient, or, like the bipolar experience, a reversal, a red-yellow-green gradient.</p>

<h4>1910-04-15 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bank for Cranfills Gap.</h4>

<p>The charter, authorizing <b>G. O. Bronstad</b>, W. T. Tergerson, Dr. Colwick and others to do a general banking business at Cranfills Gap under the laws of the state has been granted.</p>

<p>This bank will be a $10,000 proposition and the Record sees no reason why it should not be a success.</p>

<h4>1910-05-06 {<b><u>Meridian News</u></b>}</h4>
<p> Dr. T. C. Coston of Womack was called back to the Cranfills Gap community last Saturday to see a patient, and as he was making the trip in his auto, an invitation to the Record man to get in and make the trip with him was gladly accepted as we have long desired to make the good people of that thriving little city and community a visit, but not having such an opportunity extended us before. We had lived in Clifton nine years on the same job without having the pleasure of seeing this magnificent country so close to our home. From Clifton to Cranfills gap are some of the prettiest country homes, best kept farms and most thriving class of citizens it has been our pleasure to visit.</p>
<p>The people of Cranfills Gap know just how to treat a fellow to make him glad he is living in such a country; that spirit of hospitality was in evidence with every person we met.</p>
<p>We found the immense mercantile establishment of G. O. Bronstad doing a regular city rush of business; also the drug store of Colwick & Cooper in a splendid new building and the stock up-to-date and the business in a thriving condition.</p>
<p>A big base ball game between Hico and the home boys was to be pulled off that afternoon, and we could not remain long enough to yell ourselves hoarse for the boys on the Bosque side of the line. We understand the score stood 11 to 2 in favor of the Gap.</p>
<p>It was indeed gratifying to us to pass these lovely country homes, and being told by the Doctor who lived in each one, to remember that every one on trip of over twenty miles, as a regular reader of the Record and Dallas Semi-weekly News were the main papers, as the highest number of papers sent to that post office by any other Bosque county office was three, and one of them remained dead in the office.</p>
<p>The new bank building for that little city was to be started this week and rushed to completion when it will be opened and run by the thriving citizens of that place; and we were very glad to learn that our old friend John L. Huse, who is at present bookkeeper for G. O. Bronstad, had been honored with the Cashiership, as he will make a good one, and a man that has already by his sterling quality and honest dealings won the confidence and admiration of that people.  </p>

Mr. Ole Foss, my great great uncle on my Father's Mother's side is an interesting man.
<br><br>
The youngest post master of Van Zandt County Texas, was probably in that position having learned a bit of reading in Norway before alighting in the benighted lands of Four Mile, Texas, circa 1852.
The massive misfortune of the U. S. Civil War swept Ole up into Confederate Cavalry, ineptly deployed by Confederate Lt. Gen. John C. Pemberton who retreated into Vicksburg, which was quickly invested by U. S. Grant who knew better than we do now what one does with both military force and ethanol.
<br><br>
After Pemberton's surrender, Ole, not yet 20 years of age, chose joining the Union forces, enlisting in a Wisconsin Cavalry which was manned by some Wisconsin Norwegians. Few twenty year olds, perhaps none of us, could have forseen that his choice to join the Union would mean he could not return to Four Mile, Texas after organized hostilities ceased. In the South, hostilities fester now for over a century.

<h4>1911-07-14    Crisis in affairs of Texas<BR>
 				vitally involves its welfare</h4>
<h4>The Weapon of Religious Terrorism, Ostracism and Outlawry
<BR>Has Been Brought Into Use to Force Statewide Pro-
<BR>hibition Upon the People of this Great State</H4>
<p>It is the conviction of the signers of this advertisement that the present prohibition campaign has produced a crisis in the affairs of this State that vitally involves its welfare, and that would arouse the concern of every man that cherishes a regard for its political integrity and the
peace and happiness of its people. We believe it to be a public duty to invite your calm judgment to a consideration of its merits and invoke your sturdy resolution to resistance of its disastrous consequences.</P>
<p>At the outset of the campaign it was a common belief that the prohibition movement involved only an effort upon the part of its advocates to bring about the prohibition of the sale of intoxicants in Texas by means of a
constitutional amendment. Good faith and patriotic purpose were
conceded to those who believed in the virtue of this method of dealing with the question and who were proposing it for incorporation into the organic laws; and all [illegible]</P>

And however splendid a record of patriotism and devotion to the moral welfare of the State his life might present-as belonging to “the saloon crowd” or as a member of “a corrupt whiskey ring.”</P>
<p>Emboldened by their own license and not content with having flaunted this insult on the names of thousands of as good and true men as have any commonwealth, they have openly proclaimed, in effect that should they  prevail in the contest there will be [illegible]</P>  
<h4>1911-07-28 The Texas Negro </h4>
<p>The Texas negro is primarily a 
farmer and the man has made little progress in commerce,
mechanics science and art. Freedom has carried with it
responsibilities which have weighed heavily upon the colored man
and after a lapse of half a century of freedom they are still the
“drawers of water and the hewers of stone”. The young are
dependent upon the white man for their education and the aged and
infirm are his wards.</p>
<H4>The Slave Negro.</H4>
<p>In 1860 there were 158,595 slaves in Texas registered for assessment at $106,688,000, giving an average value per slave all ages of $672.00. The assessed value of all land in Texas at that time was $122,000.000 [ some digits illegible and unguessable]. The slaves were almost equal in value to all farm property constituting 36 per cent of the taxable wealth of the state. The state and county revenues derived from taxing slaves annually was approximately $1,000,000.</P>
<p>Taking into consideration the percent of true value of property rendered for assessment in 1860, and the sale of interest prevailing at that time, we find the Negroes of all ages producing a net revenue of $100 each per annum. Since the war the colored race in Texas has been able to accumulate approximately $75,000,000 which is equivalent to $2 each per annum while masters of their own destinies against a net production of $100 per annum when under the direct supervision of the white man.</P>
<H4>The Free Negro.</H4>
<p>In 1900 the census shows 620,772 Negroes in Texas. They owned 65,556 farms valued at $56,2339,240. Their farms averaged fifty-nine acres each although fifty-five Negroes owned 1000 acres and over. Over 50 per cent of
our negro farmers raised cotton and {?} per cent of all the farmers in Texas are Negroes.</P>
<p>There are 184,000 negro children of scholastic age in Texas who receive from our state school fund $6 per annum per scholar. We have 2,471 negro school houses and the education of the negro costs $1,000,000 per annum. The average salary of the teacher in colored schools is $45.88. The school
tax paid on property owned by the negro is approximately $60,000
per annum, leaving a net amount of $940,000 per annum given to
the negro annually for educational purposes.</P>
<P>The educational and industrial advantages of the negro in Texas excel those of any other state</P>
<blockquote class="gwb">
This kind of “us-vs.-them” 
attitude divides America to this day (2008-07-20).
<br><br> The division stained the original Constitution of The United States, branding a Negro 60% of a man for purposes of representation at the
 national level and treating the Negro as a unique kind of property that all men of all states were obliged to return to their owner, unlike horses that could find freedom on western ranges, constitutionally insuring no Negro could gain his freedom by flight save those strong and resourceful enough to reach Canada or Mexico or the grave.
 <br><br>Moreover the Constitution gave a grace period to slave trade, that peculiar institution that ennobled the profitable practice of making a man and his children permanent hostages to their lives.
 <br><br>This “us-vs.-them” attitude dividing white and black survived the Civil War in weaker but still robust forms like State laws calling for separate but (shabby pretense) equal facilities.<br><br> As a child I needed no instruction to avoid the “colored only” water fountain at Leonard’s Department Store. I’d never been <I><B>that</B></I>
 thirsty except after many hours trekking in mid summer sun. The Fort Worth Negro high school (Dunbar?) hard by new ploughed Interstate 35 suggested more down-in-the-mouth, under-funded institution than the shady academes I attended.
 <br><br> The first time I voted, I voted in Texas and paid my poll tax. Central Texas Congressman Pogue implicitly affirmed in the 1940’s that the role of the poll tax was to suppress the Negro vote, and if scruffiest of whites 
 could not vote either, oh well.
 <br><br>Truman, I think, saw this division threatened us. It was hard for “supermen” Nazis to usefully exploit this division, but this division was a piece of cake for Stalin. It was truly injustice that America had not

 <br><br>The greatest threat of our hypocrisy to our integrity was in military loyalty, so Truman did what he could to integrate the armed forces. During my stint in the Army (1967-1969), I saw fairly effective, thanks in part to

 integration.

<h4>Refused to Take Any Notice of the American Flag</h4>
<p>Fort Worth, Texas, April 5. -- John J. Sheppard and Raymond Dacy in their twenties when arraigned in police court this morning on a charge of disrespect to the American flag were given an opportunity to salute the flag and escape punishment. They refused; however, to budge from their seats though a big flag was draped over the police judge's desk in full view of the prisoners. This was called to their attention twice. Judge Barker find (sic) them $225 each. Sheppard has served in the regular army. The technical charge was drunkenness and disturbing the peace.   </p>


<h4>1917-04-27  Enemy Aliens At University Must Step Out</h4>
<p>  Austin, Texas, April 20.-- Enemy aliens will not be retained on the faculty of the University of Texas.<br><br>This had been revealed in the resignation of Dr. E. G. Boese, geologist in the Bureau of Economic Geology. He is a German reservist. His resignation has been received from Mexico where he went some time ago to investigate certain oil properties.</p>
<p>The decision may result in the dismissal of Dr. Eduard Prokosch, head of the School of Germanic languages. He is in Wisconsin, where he went several weeks ago. Word is being awaited, whether he is a fully naturalized citizen of the United States.</p>
<p>Prof. Charles Knizek, instructor in Slavic languages, formerly was a citizen of Austria-Hungary, but he has been naturalized.</p>
<p>All of these facts became known as a result of a conference between Dr. Vinson, president of the University, and Senator Clark.</p>
<p>The conference was in reference to a rider with the appropriations bill providing that none of the money may be paid directly, or indirectly, to any person not a citizen of the United states or of Texas.</p>
<p>Dr. Vinson has expressed the wish that the rider be chanted to refer only to enemy aliens. </p>

<h2><img src="../pic/Pinky/Gulbrand-pinky.jpg" alt="Gulbrand pic">&nbsp;G. O. Bronstad Bosque Pioneer, Passes Away.</h2>
<p>G. O. Bronstad, pioneer Bosque County citizen, died at his home at Cranfills Gap, Sunday, July 19, 1937, at about 1:45 p. m. Funeral services were conducted Monday afternoon at the St. Olaf Lutheran Church with interment in the St. Olaf Cemetery.</p>
<p>Mr. Bronstad was born March 9, 1856, in Romedal, Hedemarken, Norway. In 1874, at the age of 18, he emigrated to the United States, coming direct to Bosque County, Texas, where he joined his brother, C. O., at Valley Mills. Here in Bosque County he at once made his home and in due time adopted this country as his own. During his long life he has been an active and contributing citizen.</p>
<p>From 1874 to 1886 he lived successively at Valley Mills, Norway Mills and Morgan, engaging in business and learning merchandising. In 1886 he moved to Cranfills Gap, and opened his business concern in Cranfills Gap. Thus Mr. Bronstad successfully rounded out more than fifty years in business in this one location.</p>
<p>
In the land of his nativity he was baptized, and after proper training, was confirmed in the Lutheran Church. To this faith, confessed early in life, he remained true to the end.</p>
<p>This now departed highly respected citizen, lived a quiet, unassuming life, sincere in spirit, sympathetic, generous, and cheerful. In spite of severe experiences in business, he remained of sympathetic and kindly nature, giving service to his friends from far and near. All men were greeted with a smile in the Bronstad Store.</p>
<p>Due to the absence of his pastor, Rev. W. J. Maakestad, Rev. P. E. Thorson of Norse conducted the funeral services, assisted by Rev. O. T. Boe of Clifton and Rev. Farmer, Cranfills Gap. Inspiring music was furnished by St. Olaf Male Quartet, and by Mrs. Troll and Miss Knudson in a vocal duet.</p>
<p>Beside his wife, he leaves six children, Otis, Clyde, and Homer, Margaret, Mrs. C. L. Rohne and Mrs. Douglas Hudson. These all reside at Cranfills Gap except Mrs. Hudson, who lives in Holdenville, Okla. He is also survived by one brother, Otto, of Waco, and three sisters, Carrie and Syverine Bronstad of Waco, and Mrs Pernella Anderson, Clifton.</p>
<p>The large gathering of sorrowing friends and relatives that overflowed the spacious church was something of an indication of the high esteem in which Mr. Bronstad was held. Representatives from every section of Bosque County, from Hamilton and Coryell Counties, came to pay tribute to a good friend, a christian gentleman, an high-class merchant, a man.

<h4>1936-05-01</h4>
<h4>Couple Held Without Bail on Poison Murder Charge </h4>
<p>Mrs. Clomer Jermstad, 26, and George Pace, 27, are being held in the Bosque county jail without bail, both charged with murder in connection with fatally poisoning the woman’s husband, Menloe Jermstad, 27, who died early last Friday morning after drinking from a cup of coffee in which his wife allegedly had placed strychnine that had been supplied by Pace.</p>
<p>Signed confessions of both Mrs. Jermstad and Pace, according to county officers, state that Jermstad’s death was the result of a plot begun more than a month before for the purpose of getting rid of the woman’s husband in order that she and Pace might marry.</p>
<p>When Jermstad died Friday morning at the home of Matt Allen, with whom the Jermstad’s lived, two and a half miles southwest of Meridian, before medical aid arrived, Justice of the Peace E. H. Young, Sheriff Pearl Benson, County Attorney S. C. Smith and other county officials went to the home to hold an inquest, as is required by law in such cases. That the man had died of poisoning was indicated and the sheriff’s department began an investigation.</p>
<p>Mrs. Jermstad was brought to the courthouse for questioning twice during the day by Deputy Clark Royal, and according to the officers, both times denied knowledge of cause of her husband’s death, stating she believed it was heart trouble.</p>
<p>As the investigation progressed, the sheriff’s department learned of Pace’s alleged associations with the Jermstad family, and when Deputy Royal went to the Stockard farm for the purpose of bringing Pace in for questioning, he could not be found, but a short time later appeared in Meridian and was taken into custody. He readily admitted that he bought 20Â¢ worth of strychnine at Turner’s drug store here, stating at the time that he wanted to kill some rats, also that he gave the poison to Mrs. Jermstad, but said he saw no reason why he should be arrested. He was taken to the drug store and identified as the person to whom strychnine had been sold, then placed in jail.</p>
<p>With this information, Sheriff Benson went to the Jermstad home, and taking Mrs. Jermstad to a spot where it was thought she and Pace met the night before, told her Pace had confessed. She then agreed that Pace’s story was true, though she told the Sheriff at the same time that their meeting place the night before was at another spot, which she pointed out. She also was placed in jail, on complaint filed by the Sheriff.</p>
<p>Examining trials were held before Justice Young Friday afternoon, and both were remanded to jail without bond on charges of murder.</p>
<p>According to County Attorney S. C. Smith, Pace’s confession was in substance, as follows:</p>
<p>Jermstad and family by agreement came to his place on the Stockard farm about five months ago, where he was a tenant and batching, to keep house for him, and that a short time afterward he became intimate with Mrs. Jermstad. Her people suspected this intimacy and finally persuaded the Jermstads to move out, and they went to her uncle’s, Matt Allen’s. About a week before they left, Pace and Mrs. Jermstad made an agreement that they would get rid of her husband, but did not agree upon the method. After the Jermstads moved, he continued to meet her frequently. Soon after the family moved, Pace and the woman agreed to poison her husband. On Tuesday before Jermstad’s death, he purchased 20Â¢ worth of strychnine at Turner’s Drug Store, stating that he wanted it for the purpose of killing rats, and took it to Mrs. Jermstad that night, but they did not agree on a definite time to give it to Jermstad. On Thursday night they met near Matt Allen’s home, and she agreed to give it to him the next morning.</p>
<p>Mrs. Jermstad’s confession, in substance, was as follows, according to the county attorney:</p>
<p>She had known Pace practically all his life, but had not been intimate with him until they moved to his house. About a week before moving away, she and Pace decided to marry if they could get rid of Jermstad, and discussed getting a divorce, but she did not want her husband here on earth if she married another man. She and family moved to her uncle’s house about a month previous to the death of her husband, but she met Pace frequently at agreed places. Pace delivered the bottle of strychnine to her Tuesday night but they did not reach an agreement as to the time to give it to her husband, although Pace begged her to give it to him at the earliest time. She and Pace met Thursday night and he told her that if she did not give the poison to her husband he would take something and kill himself. She agreed to give it to her husband next morning. They had some discussion as to how to give it to him and discussed putting it in cocoa, but she decided to put it into his coffee.</p>
<p>The confession continues: Friday morning about 5:30 o’clock breakfast was prepared and she and her husband went to the table. She had already poured the contents of the bottle of strychnine into his cup, and then she filled it with coffee. He took a swallow and complained that it was bitter. She threw the remainder out and poured her coffee into his cup. She had thrown the bottle in the cook stove. In a few minutes Jermstad complained of hurting or cramping and asked her to send for a doctor. In the meantime, her uncle, Matt Allen, came in and she started for a neighbor’s, Will Martin, to get a doctor, but met Ben Neal, who came to town for a doctor. After going on to Martin’s home and staying a few minutes, she returned home and found her husband dead, and Dr. Calhoun, arrived a little later.</p>
<p>Dr. Calhoun, being unable to sign a death certificate on account of not knowing the cause of his death, notified the officers.</p>
<p>Dr. W. T. Gooch, Baylor University chemist, made an analysis of the viscera from Jermstad’s body, which was taken to Waco last Saturday morning By Deputy Sheriff Royal and P. H. Benson, Jr. Dr. Gooch made a preliminary report Monday, stating that the viscera contained strychnine in small but decided quantities.</p>
<p>Justice Young rendered an inquest verdict that Menloe Jermstad’s death was caused by poison administered by Clomer Jermstad and George Pace.</p>
<p>Funeral services for Jermstad were held Friday afternoon and burial was in St. Olaf cemetery. He was reared in the Cranfills Gap section. He is survived by his mother and two small daughters, ages 2 and 4 years, besides his wife. For the past several months he had been a WPA worker, engaged on the Meridian sidewalks project. County records show that he and Miss Clomer Allen were married Oct. 6, 1928.</p>
<p>Trials of Pace and Mrs. Jermstad probably will be held next fall, as the next grand jury does not convene until the third week in September. No move to secure their release on bond through habeas corpus proceedings has yet been made, and so far as is known, no attorney has been employed by them.</p>
<p>Pace says he went through the third grade at school and Mrs. Jermstad completed the sixth.

<h4>H. F. Hansen Dies Suddenly Friday </h4>
<p><a href="https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/G9MB-3T4" target="_blank">Hans Ferdinand Hansen</a> was born Dec. 24, 1886. His parents were Hans Jorgen Hansen and Petra Foss Hansen. He was baptized in infancy at the St. Olaf Rock Church, and later renewed his baptismal covenant on the day of his confirmation, June 15, 1902, being confirmed by the Rev. J. K. Rystad.</p>
<p>He attended public and parochial schools under Prof. A. H. Denby Olsen and attended Clifton College in 1904.</p>
<p>He was united in marriage to Gena Marie Tergerson on Aug. 2, 1906 by the Rev. G. G. Odengaard. To this union were born five daughters, two of whom died in infancy. He is survived by his wife and three daughters, Jewel Pauline (Mrs. Alton Tindall of Phillips, Texas; Wilma Adeline (Mrs. Oscar Knudson) of Carlsbad, New Mexico, and Frances Lee (Mrs. Samuel Coffey) of Winslow, Arizona, and three grandchildren, A. W. Tindall, Jr., Mary Joyce Tindall and Roger Lane Coffey. He also leaves to mourn his passing, six sisters, Mrs. Mary Gaustad, Mrs. J. T. Jenson, Mrs. G. O. Bronstad and Mrs. Newman Hastings, all of Cranfills Gap; Mrs E. E. Erickson of Clifton and Mrs. Jennie Jermstad of Fort Worth, together with a large host of more distant relatives and friends.</p>
<p>Mr. Hansen and his bride settled on the Jorgen Hansen homestead, one of the most beautiful and imposing country homes in this section, pre-empted by his parents many years before, his Father and mother having come from Denmark and Norway respectively. In the atmosphere of parental love and devotion he and his loving wife reared their children, in mutual love and happiness, until the day of his sad and sudden departure.</p>
<p>He came to assume responsibility early in life, his father passing away when, Ferdie, as he was always called, was only twelve years old. Being the only son and the youngest in the family, his responsibilities were even greater. But he grew into manhood under steady Christian influence and became a pillar in the church and community, and serving as a trustee of the local Lutheran Church at the time of his death. All who knew Mr. Hansen loved him because of his kind and pleasing disposition. Likewise he loved his friends and neighbors and enjoyed every association, making the most of the more beautiful things of life. He loved and was loved. Deep in his heart there was more tenderness, more understanding, more genuine love and affection for his family and fellowmen than you find in any man, save and except the most deeply consecrated souls.</p>
<p>He departed this life at 1:45 o'clock Friday morning, June 12, 1942, at the age of 55 years, 5 months and 18 days. Without and seeming premonition, he had lived that he might depart to his Savior, suddenly. He prayed fervently that he may be allowed to live, but said, "All would be well." The Lord saw fit to call him home to his heavenly mansions, that he might live in glorious eternity and share early his eternal reward.</p>
<p>Funeral services were conducted from the home at 3:00 o'clock and from the Lutheran Church in Cranfills gap at 3:30 o'clock Sunday afternoon. Interment was made in the St Olaf Cemetery, with Rev. B. R. Maakestad officiating at all services.</p>
<p>Active pall bearers were Messrs. Jurgen Gaustad, Ennis Erickson, Clyde Bronstad, Homer Hastings, Justin Jenson and Walter A. Hanson. Honorary pall bearers were Messrs. S. A. Hanson, C. O. Johnson, Martin Hoel, Tilden Hastings, K. M. Knudson, J. E. Bryn, John Dahl Waldemar Olson, Hubbert Olson, Willie Schibler, S. C. Knudson, G. S. Knudson, W. P. Tindall, Otto C. Pederson and Charley Hoel.</p>
<p>A male quartet consisting of A. C. Grimland, T. S. Tergerson, O. C. Knudson and Levi Bryn sang, "Will the Circle Be Unbroken," at the home and "There Will Be Sunrise For Me" was sung at the church. Mesdames Clyde and Binous Tindall also sang "Good Night Here but Good Morning Up There."</p>
<p>Flower girls were Mrs. Paul Christenson, Loverne and Geraldine Rohne, Mrs. Leroy Troll, Marguerite Bronstad, Rosa Lee Hastings, Maurine Rohne, Junelle Jenson and Gene Knudson.</p>

<br><br>
Mrs. Clomer Jermstad murdered her husband, Menloe, with strychnine in May of 1936.<br><br>
"<i>Funeral services for Jermstad were held Friday afternoon and burial was in St. Olaf cemetery. He was reared in the Cranfills Gap section. He is survived by his mother and two small daughters, ages 2 and 4 years, besides his wife. For the past several months he had been a WPA worker, engaged on the Meridian sidewalks project. County records show that he and Miss Clomer Allen were married Oct. 6, 1928.</i>"
In 1944, the U. S. was in the middle of WWII; having able-bodied people in jail who were no threat to the public was regarded as a waste of manpower. First Clomer then George were released from prison.
<br><br>
This can’t have been easy for great aunt Jennie, but how could she not want to see her granddaughters, grown to 13 and 15 years of age, and likely images of her son?

<h4>Clifton Record, 1941-05-02</h4> 
<p>   Cranfills  Gap suffered the most serious fire loss in the business district this past week and has retarded the forward movement of this town for some time to come. A blaze of undetermined origin at about 10 o&rsquo;clock Tuesday evening, April 22, put the Anderson Food Store out of commission.  </p> <p>   Mr. Anderson has almost suffered a nervous breakdown, but he is a man of much courage and will soon be about some kind of business, but he is undecided yet what he will do. The building was owned by Mr. Otto Reesing but Mr. Anderson had been operating a successful food store there for a little more than a year.</p> <p>   The devastating fire in the store apparently started in the back of the building but soon spread to the front of the one-story structure. Help was called from Meridian and the fire fighters did a mighty fine job in extinguishing the fire in record time, and in saving the Helm Grocery, Wiley&rsquo;s café and Grimland&rsquo;s hardware store. The stillness of the night was a great help in stopping the rampage of the fire. Building and contents were partly covered by insurance.</p>

<h2>Walt Remembering</h2>
<h2>Laura Wilhelmina(Hansen) Bronstad: Grandma Bronstad:</h2>
<p>She and Margaret lived in the house up the south side of the escarpment we were wont 
to call, “Bronstad Mountain.” At that time ‘47, ‘48, ‘49, or ‘50 there was a tight circular 
drive, un paved in front of a fenced yard.</p>
<p>If you drove up the steep hill at limit of her property to the west, there was a wooden 
garage which, curiously, had wooden ﬂoor. The door, if there ever was one, long gone.  
The inside no longer could hold a car it held reject items among which were surplus 
canning jars, an unworkable pump organ, and the occasional nesting sparrow. Likely 
my memory of a full garage was after my Father Clyde moved his family into the 
Bronstad house.</p>
<p>Outside the east wall of the garage lay a treasure trove of broken and discarded ﬁn de 
circle technology. The long, steel, counter-weight arm of a cotton bale scale, obsolete 
contact switches from a 19th century telephone switchboard replaced in 1913, failed 
hand crank petroleum pump, its casting broken. Near the garage stood a cylindrical 
cement water cistern connected by pipe to the windmill further down the incline toward 
the house.</p>
<p>Adjacent to the windmill, a pump house which housed a massive, stove-black, one 
cylinder engine which once pumped household water. The windmill must have replaced 
the engine whose case had broken - perhaps by a freeze, perhaps through poor 
engineering, poor fabrication. The pump house, post war, held tools of laundry: Ms 
Stewart’s Blueing, cardboard cartons used to mold homemade soap, a wood framed 
corrugated wash board and a crank-operated clothes wringer. In the pump house too 
stood cast iron shoe lasts, remnants of Bronstad Store time when shoe repair was a 
paying service.  Outside stood a 25 gallon, cast iron, 3 legged kettle that Maggie used 
to heat water by open ﬁre, then wash laundry. She used a hoe, barely functional after 
decades of sharpening, its wood near the working end ﬁre hardened from the many 
times she’d pulled the embers away from the kettle, the better to stir the steaming 
kettle of dirty clothes.</p>
<p>North east of the pump house stood a modest stable, long unused for horses, for 
Grandpa Bronstad had been an early purchaser (1913), if not driver, of a Model T Ford. 
The separated, walled back quarter of the stable was used for chicken feed mid 20th 
century. Not far from the stable leaned ever so slightly the three hole outhouse.  Down 
slope from the stable and outhouse was a plot for a garden. Garden fertility must have 
depended heavily on production from the one-horse stable, for in my childhood, it’s 
alkaline, clay-caliche soil nurtured little more than broom weeds.  At the southeast 
corner of garden plot was the gate to a short path to Aunt Marie and Uncle Chris’s 
house, the solid brick, Rohne house of a community banker.</p>
<p>Bronstad house itself was an old marriage of two settler structures. The smaller part lay 
to the east,  a one story kitchen with a tattered edge linoleum covering much of the 
wooden ﬂoor. A wood ﬁred kitchen range dominated the interior, a four place white 
cream painted. kitchen table complemented it. Along the south wall a multi-purpose 
utility cabinet, having a screen paneled pie safe at top, bins to hold ten or more pounds 
of ﬂour and sugar, a shallow working surface, and cabinets below. Along the north wall 
was a cabinet with wooden working surface. A single cold water spigot pierced the 
bead board wall; beneath the spigot was not a sink, but a ﬁve gallon bucket. West of 
the spigot was an outside door opening north to the scattering of buildings  uphill.!
There must have been an ice box, but I can neither remember nor visualize it. It would 
have been replaced when, after Laura’s death, Clyde moved his family from ‘Homer’s’ 
house, 300 yards down hill from the Bronstad house where he had been born. Likely 
the ice box went into the garage, making room for an electric refrigerator when Mother 
and father moved in.</p>
<p>The kitchen had three entrances and windows to the East and South.  East windows 
looked at a wan walnut tree, the path across the garden space to the Rohne house and 
next the trumpet vine betting its well being on the septic tank drain ﬁeld.</p>
<p>The south window looked across the screened-in porch, a door led from kitchen to 
back porch. You could go left to the bathroom which had a short claw foot enamel tub 
and cold running water. There was also a ﬂush toilet which, owing to the sluggish drain 
ﬁeld, I was discouraged from using, and encouraged toward the three-holer 40 yards 
up the hill.</p>
<hr class="yr">
<p>The larger, two storied part of the house had two bedrooms below, two sleeping 
spaces  and attic storage above. At ground level a hallway and staircase to the second 
ﬂoor sleeping areas isolated the west bedroom. The staircase was son of a ladder and 
ascended steeply into windowless dark. To the west of the stair landing was a low door 
that opened to the boys’ sleeping room. It became mine. I slept under the sagging 
wallpaper that once attached to the lathed underside of the pitched roof. In the wind it 
billowed and waved like window curtains and hinted at accumulated dirt like salt in a 
salt shaker.</p>
<p>In the boys’ room there were two beds and a small writing desk. The bed beneath the 
west window had no springs, rather a woven metal fabric attached to the wooden 
frame. This let it act as a well behaved hammock, but too dirty and rusty to risk 
staining bedding. The other bed had exposed coil springs supporting a 3 inch thick 
cotton ticking mattress.  The other window looked out over the room sized front porch. 
A mature juniper tree at the west edge of the porch allowed a young boy an alternate 
entrance and egress. The window also permitted a less frightening way for a boy to 
urinate and avoid a cold nighttime trip down stairs to the opposite end of the house. </p>
<p>To the east of the stairs was the girls’ bed room and a storage space that in Clyde’s 
occupancy became a collective walk-in closet with bailing wire stapled to the 
underside of rafters serving as hanger bar. Dust danced in the thin shafts of light that 
shone through the cracks and gaps in the aging, wooden shingle roof. The only second 
ﬂoor north window looked out from this attic.</p>
<p>A south window looked out from the girls’  room, looked over Dr. Holt’s roof, across 
highway 22, Austin Branch, the public school, and the road to Clifton: almost the whole 
span of the valley of the Austin Branch of the Meridian creek, tributary to the Bosque 
River.  (In wetter geologic eras for central Texas, the Bosque must have been majestic; 
even now it maintains a trickle even in worst of drought.) In the time of my witness, the 
girl’s room was Maggies. The. Boy that was me, spied on it surreptitiously from the 
door part ajar.</p>
<p>Below the girls room, on the bottom ﬂoor, was the master bedroom. It had windows to 
the west, south and east making it the brightest and in summer breeziest room of the 
house. Beﬁtting the master bedroom, it housed a pot bellied, cast iron, wood stove 
resting on a ﬁre-stop tin sheet. The cylindrical, sheet metal ﬂue boasted a damper with 
wire-wound handle, then did a sharp 90 degree turn to vent into the brick-lined 
chimney that continued up through the roof, oﬀering a hint of heat to the girls bedroom 
above.  Like many rural, ground ﬂoor bedrooms, this one had a door opening 
immediately to outside at the front porch.  A glass door, hinged writing-desk-cabinet on 
the interior wall held Gulbrand and Laura’s library : a large family bible, books written in 
Norwegian, a weighty tomb detailing the Titanic disaster, and Grandpa Bronstad’s 
brass telescope.</p>
<p>In this master bedroom, Laura Wilhelmina (Hansen) Bronstad succumbed to her last 
bout of pneumonia.  Dr Holt’s. Penicillin was unequal to the task of keeping her alive. 
She wanted to end thirteen years of widowhood and join Gulbrand in heaven. The wear 
of care she could no longer bear. Osteoporosis reduced spirit and spine. Necrophagy 
devoured the night, leaving no more days.</p>
<p>Maggie cared for her mother, and must have called on Doctor Holt, the next house 
down hill, who then pronounced her dead. Maggie would have called Marie, then Otis, 
then Clyde, then Lorine, then Homer, then Aunt Tilde, Aunt Jenny, Aunt Celia and Aunt 
Martha. Aunt Mary Gaustad had died the previous year. Then Reverend B. R. 
Maakestad.</p>
<p>The following day, April, 25, 1950, Laura lay in casket in the west bedroom, least 
heated room in the house, last day of her 57 years in her house.</p>
<p>Wally, nine years old, mastering cultural norms, told his 3 year old sister she was 
supposed to cry, especially after viewing her grandmother for the last time in her 
casket. For the ﬁrst and perhaps only time, Bette did as Wally bid.</p>
<p>That is the only memory of Laura that I can date. The day following her death.</p>
<p>The earliest memory of her that Wally [i.e. yours truly, as I was known then], now 78, 
can reliably retrieve is of a butter and sugar sandwich. Wally gained entrance at the 
south, porch as a boy of 6 or 7 or eight perhaps on a rural boy’s walk-about.  More 
likely Laura asked Wally’s mother for the visit and the lad knocked ﬁrst at the front 
(bedroom door), then at the side to gain his grandmother’s attention</p>
<p>Slow, shuﬄe walking she opened the porch screen door and recognized Wally on  the 
ground below. “You’re Clyde’s boy aren’t you? Wally wrestled with his poorly 
understood calculus of human relationships and decided, “yes”, for he’d heard that 
was his identity a time or two before, but never before without his parents nearby.!
Wally’s parents were able talkers, but Wally was not; Laura had to plumb her repertoire 
of little boy talk. “I’ll bet you’re hungry, aren’t you?!</p>
<p>“What have you got?” Countered Wally, surveying an unfamiliar and seemingly barren 
kitchen.!</p>
<p>Laura was used to feeding herself and Maggie, but feeding a little boy outside of 
mealtime was problematic.  She lived simply and meals were brought forth with labor, 
not labor saving devices more advanced than windmill ground-water piped inside her 
house. Food was preserved with salt, or sugar or pickling or smoking. Her ice box was 
a relatively expensive luxury requiring frequent purchases of blocks of ice if one 
needed keep food mid summer.</p>
<p>“I’ll bet you’d like a butter and sugar sandwich,”</p>
<p>“Sandwiches” to a 7-year old had meant peanut butter and jelly or bologna and 
mayonnaise. What grandma oﬀered sounded strange and doubtful. I was wary , but it 
was pleasing to eat.</p>
<p>Other memories  are earlier, but undateable. Age aﬀords tool of understandings giving 
perspectives more valid than calendrical date.</p>
<h3>The proﬀered dime </h3>
<p>The proﬀered dime confounded my childhood, adolescent and adult memory. Circa 1949.
1949, my Aunt Maggie and my penurious grandmother gifted me a dime. But I was not 
to waste it on disparaged comic books (then royally priced at $ 0.10). No, I was to 
enter the list, attempt the capture of a greased piglet to be loosed at a community 
event, night time on the Cranﬁlls Gap, multi-purposed, football ﬁeld.
</p>
<p>I was far more afraid of a piglet than the piglet of me. A local farm boy, probably 
familiar with delights of roast piglet, or at a minimum familiar with containing errant 
pigs, captured that crowd pleasing contest of that dusty autumn night.!
Almost certainly the source and motivation behind the dime was Uncle Chris, town 
Banker, town booster, town reporter. Chris Ludwig Rohne endured daunting 
circumstances.</p>
<p>Cranﬁlls Gap was one of the smaller communities in Bosque County. Most rural 
counties in rural Texas suﬀered population decline since the 1920’s. There was a small 
population return from urban to rural at the worst of the Great Depression, but World 
War II swept-up many young men into military service and many older men into urban 
war industry.  War’s end let many return to their rural roots, but  military 
decommissioning was halted by the “Cold War”, there was no end-of-war depression 
and the lure of urban areas intensiﬁed.  Eventually Father and family followed, but long 
before the Clyde Bronstad family removal and well after, Uncle Chris Rohne waged a 
rear guard action, trying to hold the community of Cranﬁlls Gap together.</p>
<p>If a banker is to prosper, his community needs to prosper. A community needs 
cohesion and identity. Throughout his adult working life, the twenties, through the 
ﬁfties, Chris promoted cohesion and identity in many ways. One visible trace was his 
writings in “The Clifton Record.”  There he mourned the recently departed, honored 
courage and and endurance, cheered on the Gap Lions, and urged on new directions 
in local, agricultural enterprise.  His writings were literary, laudatory and illuminating.</p>


    <p>If there is a Combat Infantrymans’ badge, there should be a Community Retreat 
    Guardsman badge. Uncle Chris is due one.</p>
     <p>Even as his community retreated under intense socio-economic ﬁre, Chris Ludwig 
    Rohne held his post. Long past the depression era desperado who imprisoned Chris in 
    his own suﬀocating, bank vault; Chris carried on until his cigar tobacco poisoned heart 
    gave out.</p>
    <p>A lot of my very Southern Uncles bore scars of tobacco’s poison.!

<h4><a id="Obit-LauraWBronstad">1950-04-28</a></h4>
<h3>Mrs. G. O. Bronstad Claimed by Death At Cranfills Gap</h3>
<p>Mrs. Laura Wilhelmina Hanson[sic] Bronstad was born of parents Hans Jergen and Petra Hanson[sic] December 11, 1873, at the old family homestead about four miles East of Cranfills Gap. She was baptized in infancy by the Rev. J. K. Rystad in Our Saviour's Lutheran Church at Norse. She was confirmed in the Lutheran faith by the same pastor and in the same church on June 23, 1889. On November 30, 1893, she was united in marriage to G. O. Bronstad at the old Rock Church near the old Hanson[sic] home. To this union were born six children, three sons, Otis and Clyde of Cranfills Gap, and Homer of Vernon; three daughters, Marie, Mrs. Chris Rohne, and Marguerite, both of Cranfills Gap, and Lorine, Mrs Douglas Hudson, of Holdenville, Oklahoma. Besides the above children she is survived by thirteen grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren</p>
<p>She is survived by four sisters, namely Mathilda, Mrs. Thomas Jenson, Celia, Mrs. Emil Erickson, Martha, Mrs. Newman Hastings, and Mrs. Jennie Jermstad. She was preceded in death by her husband on July 18, 1937. Her only brother, Ferdie Hanson, died on June 12, 1942. Her oldest sister, Mary Gaustad, also preceded her in death May 21, 1949.</p>
<p>Grandmother Bronstad, as she became affectionately known in her family circle, passed away peacefully in her Cranfills Gap home, where she had lived for 57 years, at about 7:00 a.m. April 24, 1950, at the age of 76 years, 4 months and 13 days.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bronstad lived a life of deep Christian conviction and devotion to her church. She lived a life of complete surrender to her Saviour. She was sure in her faith and true to her Lord. In this assurance she lived a joyful life. The unselfish love for her family and friends will long be remembered. May god bless her memory.</p>
<p>Funeral services were held at the Bronstad home in Cranfills Gap, Tuesday, April 25, at 2:00 p.m. and at St. Olaf Lutheran Church at 2:30 p.m., with the pastor, Rev. B. R. Maakestad, in charge. The audience sang the hymn "Jesus Priceless Treasure" and the ladies' Chorus of the church sang, "I'm But a Strange Here" and "I Know of a Sleep In Jesus Name."</p>
<p>Chris L. Rohne spoke in behalf of the family and read the great number of greetings and memorials. There were also a great number of beautiful floral pieces.
