<P>Remembering</P>
<P>Laura Wilhelmina(Hansen) Bronstad: Grandma Bronstad:</p>
<p>She and Margaret lived in the house up the south side of the escarpment we were wont 
to call, “Bronstad Mountain.” At that time ‘47, ‘48, ‘49, or ‘50 there was a tight circular 
drive, un paved in front of a fenced yard.</p>
<p>If you drove up the steep hill at limit of her property to the west, there was a wooden 
garage which, curiously, had wooden ﬂoor. The door, if there ever was one, long gone.  
The inside no longer could hold a car it held reject items among which were surplus 
canning jars, an unworkable pump organ, and the occasional nesting sparrow. Likely 
my memory of a full garage was after my Father Clyde moved his family into the 
Bronstad house.</p>
<p>Outside the east wall of the garage lay a treasure trove of broken and discarded ﬁn de 
circle technology. The long, steel, counter-weight arm of a cotton bale scale, obsolete 
contact switches from a 19th century telephone switchboard replaced in 1913, failed 
hand crank petroleum pump, its casting broken. Near the garage stood a cylindrical 
cement water cistern connected by pipe to the windmill further down the incline toward 
the house.</p>
<p>Adjacent to the windmill, a pump house which housed a massive, stove-black, one 
cylinder engine which once pumped household water. The windmill must have replaced 
the engine whose case had broken - perhaps by a freeze, perhaps through poor 
engineering, poor fabrication. The pump house, post war, held tools of laundry: Ms 
Stewart’s Blueing, cardboard cartons used to mold homemade soap, a wood framed 
corrugated wash board and a crank-operated clothes wringer. In the pump house too 
stood cast iron shoe lasts, remnants of Bronstad Store time when shoe repair was a 
paying service.  Outside stood a 25 gallon, cast iron, 3 legged kettle that Maggie used 
to heat water by open ﬁre, then wash laundry. She used a hoe, barely functional after 
decades of sharpening, its wood near the working end ﬁre hardened from the many 
times she’d pulled the embers away from the kettle, the better to stir the steaming 
kettle of dirty clothes.</p>
<p>North east of the pump house stood a modest stable, long unused for horses, for 
Grandpa Bronstad had been an early purchaser (1913), if not driver, of a Model T Ford. 
The separated, walled back quarter of the stable was used for chicken feed mid 20th 
century. Not far from the stable leaned ever so slightly the three hole outhouse.  Down 
slope from the stable and outhouse was a plot for a garden. Garden fertility must have 
depended heavily on production from the one-horse stable, for in my childhood, it’s 
alkaline, clay-caliche soil nurtured little more than broom weeds.  At the southeast 
corner of garden plot was the gate to a short path to Aunt Marie and Uncle Chris’s 
house, the solid brick, Rohne house of a community banker.!
Bronstad house itself was an old marriage of two settler structures. The smaller part lay 
to the east,  a one story kitchen with a tattered edge linoleum covering much of the 
wooden ﬂoor. A wood ﬁred kitchen range dominated the interior, a four place white 
cream painted. kitchen table complemented it. Along the south wall a multi-purpose 
utility cabinet, having a screen paneled pie safe at top, bins to hold ten or more pounds 
of ﬂour and sugar, a shallow working surface, and cabinets below. Along the north wall 
was a cabinet with wooden working surface. A single cold water spigot pierced the 
bead board wall; beneath the spigot was not a sink, but a ﬁve gallon bucket. West of 
the spigot was an outside door opening north to the scattering of buildings  uphill.!
There must have been an ice box, but I can neither remember nor visualize it. It would 
have been replaced when, after Laura’s death, Clyde moved his family from ‘Homer’s’ 
house, 300 yards down hill from the Bronstad house where he had been born. Likely 
the ice box went into the garage, making room for an electric refrigerator when Mother 
and father moved in.</p>
<p>The kitchen had three entrances and windows to the East and South.  East windows 
looked at a wan walnut tree, the path across the garden space to the Rohne house and 
next the trumpet vine betting its well being on the septic tank drain ﬁeld.</p>
The south window looked across the screened-in porch, a door led from kitchen to 
back porch. You could go left to the bathroom which had a short claw foot enamel tub 
and cold running water. There was also a ﬂush toilet which, owing to the sluggish drain 
ﬁeld, I was discouraged from using, and encouraged toward the three-holer 40 yards 
up the hill.</p>
<p>- - - - - - -</p>
<p>The larger, two storied part of the house had two bedrooms below, two sleeping 
spaces  and attic storage above. At ground level a hallway and staircase to the second 
ﬂoor sleeping areas isolated the west bedroom. The staircase was son of a ladder and 
ascended steeply into windowless dark. To the west of the stair landing was a low door 
that opened to the boys’ sleeping room. It became mine. I slept under the sagging 
wallpaper that once attached to the lathed underside of the pitched roof. In the wind it 
billowed and waved like window curtains and hinted at accumulated dirt like salt in a 
salt shaker.</p>
<p>In the boys’ room there were two beds and a small writing desk. The bed beneath the 
west window had no springs, rather a woven metal fabric attached to the wooden 
frame. This let it act as a well behaved hammock, but too dirty and rusty to risk 
staining bedding. The other bed had exposed coil springs supporting a 3 inch thick 
cotton ticking mattress.  The other window looked out over the room sized front porch. 
A mature juniper tree at the west edge of the porch allowed a young boy an alternate 
entrance and egress. The window also permitted a less frightening way for a boy to 
urinate and avoid a cold nighttime trip down stairs to the opposite end of the house. </p>
To the east of the stairs was the girls’ bed room and a storage space that in Clyde’s 
occupancy became a collective walk-in closet with bailing wire stapled to the 
underside of rafters serving as hanger bar. Dust danced in the thin shafts of light that 
shone through the cracks and gaps in the aging, wooden shingle roof. The only second 
ﬂoor north window looked out from this attic.</p>
<p>A south window looked out from the girls’  room, looked over Dr. Holt’s roof, across 
highway 22, Austin Branch, the public school, and the road to Clifton: almost the whole 
span of the valley of the Austin Branch of the Meridian creek, tributary to the Bosque 
River.  (In wetter geologic eras for central Texas, the Bosque must have been majestic; 
even now it maintains a trickle even in worst of drought.) In the time of my witness, the 
girl’s room was Maggies. The. Boy that was me, spied on it surreptitiously from the 
door part ajar.</p>
<p>Below the girls room, on the bottom ﬂoor, was the master bedroom. It had windows to 
the west, south and east making it the brightest and in summer breeziest room of the 
house. Beﬁtting the master bedroom, it housed a pot bellied, cast iron, wood stove 
resting on a ﬁre-stop tin sheet. The cylindrical, sheet metal ﬂue boasted a damper with 
wire-wound handle, then did a sharp 90 degree turn to vent into the brick-lined 
chimney that continued up through the roof, oﬀering a hint of heat to the girls bedroom 
above.  Like many rural, ground ﬂoor bedrooms, this one had a door opening 
immediately to outside at the front porch.  A glass door, hinged writing-desk-cabinet on 
the interior wall held Gulbrand and Laura’s library : a large family bible, books written in 
Norwegian, a weighty tomb detailing the Titanic disaster, and Grandpa Bronstad’s 
brass telescope.</p>
<p>In this master bedroom, Laura Wilhelmina (Hansen) Bronstad succumbed to her last 
bout of pneumonia.  Dr Holt’s. Penicillin was unequal to the task of keeping her alive. 
She wanted to end thirteen years of widowhood and join Gulbrand in heaven. The wear 
of care she could no longer bear. Osteoporosis reduced spirit and spine. Necrophagy 
devoured the night, leaving no more days.</p>
<p>Maggie cared for her mother, and must have called on Doctor Holt, the next house 
down hill, who then pronounced her dead. Maggie would have called Marie, then Otis, 
then Clyde, then Lorine, then Homer, then Aunt Tilde, Aunt Jenny, Aunt Celia and Aunt 
Martha. Aunt Mary Gaustad had died the previous year. Then Reverend B. R. 
Maakestad.</p>
<p>The following day, April, 25, 1950, Laura lay in casket in the west bedroom, least 
heated room in the house, last day of her 57 years in her house.</p>
Wally, nine years old, mastering cultural norms, told his 3 year old sister she was 
supposed to cry, especially after viewing her grandmother for the last time in her 
casket. For the ﬁrst and perhaps only time, Bette did as Wally bid.</p>
That is the only memory of Laura that I can date. The day following her death.</p>
The earliest memory of her that Wally [i.e. yours truly, as I was known then], now 78, 
can reliably retrieve is of a butter and sugar sandwich. Wally gained entrance at the 
south, porch as a boy of 6 or 7 or eight perhaps on a rural boy’s walk-about.  More 
likely Laura asked Wally’s mother for the visit and the lad knocked ﬁrst at the front 
(bedroom door), then at the side to gain his grandmother’s attention.</p>
Slow, shuﬄe walking she opened the porch screen door and recognized Wally on  the 
ground below. “You’re Clyde’s boy aren’t you? Wally wrestled with his poorly 
understood calculus of human relationships and decided, “yes”, for he’d heard that 
was his identity a time or two before, but never before without his parents nearby.!
Wally’s parents were able talkers, but Wally was not; Laura had to plumb her repertoire 
of little boy talk. “I’ll bet you’re hungry, aren’t you?!
“What have you got?” Countered Wally, surveying an unfamiliar and seemingly barren 
kitchen.!
Laura was used to feeding herself and Maggie, but feeding a little boy outside of 
mealtime was problematic.  She lived simply and meals were brought forth with labor, 
not labor saving devices more advanced than windmill ground-water piped inside her 
house. Food was preserved with salt, or sugar or pickling or smoking. Her ice box was 
a relatively expensive luxury requiring frequent purchases of blocks of ice if one 
needed keep food mid summer.</p>
“I’ll bet you’d like a butter and sugar sandwich,”</p>
“Sandwiches” to a 7-year old had meant peanut butter and jelly or bologna and 
mayonnaise. What grandma oﬀered sounded strange and doubtful. I was wary , but it 
was pleasing to eat.</p>
Other memories  are earlier, but undateable. Age aﬀords tool of understandings giving 
perspectives more valid than calendrical date.</p>
The proﬀered dime 
The proﬀered dime confounded my childhood, adolescent and adult memory. Circa 
1949, my Aunt Maggie and my penurious grandmother gifted me a dime. But I was not 
to waste it on disparaged comic books (then royally priced at $ 0.10). No, I was to 
enter the list, attempt the capture of a greased piglet to be loosed at a community 
event, night time on the Cranﬁlls Gap, multi-purposed, football ﬁeld.</p>
</p>
I was far more afraid of a piglet than the piglet of me. A local farm boy, probably 
familiar with delights of roast piglet, or at a minimum familiar with containing errant 
pigs, captured that crowd pleasing contest of that dusty autumn night.!
Almost certainly the source and motivation behind the dime was Uncle Chris, town 
Banker, town booster, town reporter. Chris Ludwig Rohne endured daunting 
circumstances.</p>
Cranﬁlls Gap was one of the smaller communities in Bosque County. Most rural 
counties in rural Texas suﬀered population decline since the 1920’s. There was a small 
population return from urban to rural at the worst of the Great Depression, but World 
War II swept-up many young men into military service and many older men into urban 
war industry.  War’s end let many return to their rural roots, but  military 
decommissioning was halted by the “Cold War”, there was no end-of-war depression 
and the lure of urban areas intensiﬁed.  Eventually Father and family followed, but long 
before the Clyde Bronstad family removal and well after, Uncle Chris Rohne waged a 
rear guard action, trying to hold the community of Cranﬁlls Gap together.</p>
If a banker is to prosper, his community needs to prosper. A community needs 
cohesion and identity. Throughout his adult working life, the twenties, through the 
ﬁfties, Chris promoted cohesion and identity in many ways. One visible trace was his 
writings in “The Clifton Record.”  There he mourned the recently departed, honored 
courage and and endurance, cheered on the Gap Lions, and urged on new directions 
in local, agricultural enterprise.  His writings were literary, laudatory and illuminating.</p>

    If there is a Combat Infantrymans’ badge, there should be a Community Retreat 
    Guardsman badge. Uncle Chris is due one.</p>
    Even as his community retreated under intense socio-economic ﬁre, Chris Ludwig 
    Rohne held his post. Long past the depression era desperado who imprisoned Chris in 
    his own suﬀocating, bank vault; Chris carried on until his cigar tobacco poisoned heart 
    gave out.</p>
    A lot of my very Southern Uncles bore scars of tobacco’s poison.!
    She is survived by four sisters, namely Mathilda, Mrs. Thomas 
    Jenson, Celia, Mrs. Emil Erickson, Martha, Mrs. Newman Hastings, 
    and Mrs. Jennie Jermstad. She was preceded in death by her husband 
    on July 18, 1937. Her only brother, Ferdie Hanson, died on June 12, 
    1942. Her oldest sister, Mary Gaustad, also preceded her in death May 
    21, 1949.</p>
<p> 
    Grandmother Bronstad, as she became affectionately known in her 
    family circle, passed away peacefully in her Cranfills Gap home, 
    where she had lived for 57 years, at about 7:00 a.m. April 24, 1950, at
