			<h5><a id= "CRX_Christian Olson Bronstad">Biography of couples
			 in Golden wedding</a></H5>
				<P>In a peaceful valley of Norway, known as Romedal, in Hedemarken, there was born a baby boy, August 20, 1853. He was the third child in the family and the second son. His parents were Ole and Christine Bronstad.</p>
				<P>These people chose Christian as the name of their new charge.</p>
				<P>Here in the nurture of a beautiful country and kind parents, Christian thrived. In due time the boy was initiated into school work; his first school being located in a farm house where he attended school two years. [?] the Prestehjeid, or county, built a school house to which the boy was sent. The boy's father was a carpenter by trade, but was later put in charge of a mill. In this work, Christian often worked with his father.</p>
				<P>During his teens, Christian heard glowing tales of America, the land of opportunity, of prosperity and freedom and of the bright things awaiting a young man there. Thus this young man's mind was soon {?} on coming to America. So when Mr. Hendrick Dahl visited back in Norway after having been in America, young Christian fell in line with many others and with Mr. Dahl as escort bid his native land, his friends and all his relations a fond farewell and turned toward America to seek his fortune. The party on leaving Norway set Bosque county, Texas, as their destination. In the first part of Nov. 1872, Christain <A NAME = "COB4">Bronstad</a> the young emigrant, left Norway. In Bordeaux, France, the party was held up three days. in Liverpool the ship Louisiana of the State Line was boarded. Immediately seasickness, and no doubt, homesickness, started. About a month was spent on the Atlantic, and for three days all passengers were shut up on account of the storms. Our immigrant landed at New Orleans, whence he was carried by rail and ships to Galveston, Texas. One of these ships was a mixed ship carrying immigrants, cattle, and everything else. Finally on Dec. 19th, 1872 this immigrant at the age of 18, arrived in Waco, Texas. This was a severely cold day and the Brazos was frozen over solid.</p>
				<P>On arriving at Waco, Christian was met by Peter Tingstad, one of his four acquaintances in Texas, who helped him find employment. Young Christian landed a job as a dish washer in the "Lady Gay Restaurant," located on the square. Here he worked five days, and had sleeping quarters on the second floor of the same building. Five days a resident of Waco, he fell ill with typhoid fever.</p>
				<P>After a few days, Frank Jackson, better known as Frank Bean, a darky living among the Norwegians of Bosque, came to Waco, and Christian rode to Bosque with him in his wagon. While resting on the way the negro left the wagon ,and on his return carried a hat full of eggs. The sick immigrant boy was taken by the negro to the Omenson home on Neils Creek. Here under the care of Dr. Cowen and the Omensons and Tingstads, he was brought back to health. However Dr. Cowen had declared that "The little Norwegian boy can't live much longer." Through the spring of '73 the boy was too weak for work, but later in the year he was employed in the saw mill and flour mills at Valley Mills. While at Valley Mills, Christian -- that was his name while there -- passed through the difficulties and embarrassments of learning the English language. To help in this, he even subscribed for a cheap paper published in Atlanta, Georgia. From the darkies, who enjoyed the little Norwegian and often loafed about the mill, he learned much, for with other people he felt embarrassed over his broken English. After being at Valley Mills about two years, having been recommended by Mr. [illegible] he took up his duties at the mills at Norway Mills on Neils Creek. His salary was $35.00 per month--a stupendous salary at that time. Meantime his brother Gulbrand, had joined him; his parents and others of the family coming to America still later. And so in 1877 we find Christian a miller at Norway Mills, Texas</p>
				<P>In 1853 in Cherokee county, Texas, there lived a young couple, Ole and Antoinette Olson. On the 20th of Nov. 1855 there was born to this couple a baby boy, and they named him Oscar Miller. hence Oscar Miller Olson is a native Texan. In 1860 this couple moved to Brownsboro, Texas, where Mr. Olson was employed in a woodwork and blacksmith shop, which shop he later bought. But failing health caused him to sell and move to Bosque county. In 1861 this family with their 6 year old son, Oscar, bought a farm in the Norse community and settled. When the war came on Mr. Olson became a soldier in the Confederate army and was stationed at Tyler, Texas in a government shop. The family moved to Tyler and the young Oscar often helped his father with his work on second floor of the government shop, where Mr. Olson was in charge. After the war the family moved to their Bosque county farm.</p>
				<P>Oscar Miller Olson was first in school at the old Peck school located in north of the so-called "sokkerton" or sugar loaf west of Norse. This school building was of a log cabin structure, had a dirt floor, one door, one shutter a fireplace and the benches were of split log. Oscar's first teacher was a Mr. Ole Olson, commonly called Red Ole --his hair suggesting the name. In school Oscar, a full fledged Texas of that time was a real boy, full of life and vigor. He was liked pretty well by the teacher, though, and was granted special privileges, such as studying out-doors in the shade of trees, etc. On account of this the other boys poked fun at him, But the doctor still feels that no one got the best of him</p>
				<P>Young Oscar often helped his dad make matches, scarce articles in those times. On one occasion after dipping a thousand or more matches, much labor was lost. The matches were left in the open over night to dry. in the morning they were forgotten and the warm sun soon ignited the phosphorus tipped sticks and all went up in smoke. As time went on this young man's interest turned to medicine. Consequently in 1872 we find Oscar M. Olson beginning the study of medicine under Dr. J. G. Parshal, on second floor of the old rock school building on the east bank of the Bosque River at Clifton. Here he studied part-time under Dr. Tergerson. This year's work under a doctor gave him a year's credit in medical college. Next he attended the Galveston Medical College, then a private institution. He graduated from this school in 1873. After graduation he was in the drug business and practiced medicine at Norway Mills and there we fine him in 1877.</p>
				<P>In 1854 Ovee Colwick and his wife, Johanna, came to America, and in 1855, with their son, Theodore, they were living in LaSalle county, Ill. Here Dec. 8, 1855, a daughter was Born, and she was named Margaret Cecilia Hjelm. On May 20th 1857, another girl came into this family, and she was named Martha Christine. By early spring 1859, induced by reports of cheap and good land in Texas, and possibly by a desire to move to a less thickly settled country, and led on by that pioneer and colonizer Kleng Peerson, Mr. and Mrs. Ovee Colwick, with their four children, Theodore, Margaret, Martha, and John, started for Texas. With them on this trip was Mrs. B. C. Martin, a sister of Mrs. Colwick. Four weeks were spent sailing down the Mississippi River to New Orleans. From there another ship carried them on to Galveston, whence they reshipped to Houston. From Houston they traveled by ox cart to Neills Creek valley in Bosque county. Kleng Peerson, growing old and weary, gave to Ovee Colwick half of the estate given him as colonizer by the state. In return for this he was to have a home and be cared for the rest of his life, and until his death he lived with the Colwicks.</p>
				<P>These two girls, Margaret and Martha, started their school careers in the old Peck school near the Sugar Loaf mountain -- the same school in which Oscar Olson also attended. . . . The</p>

				<H5 CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME = "D">Obituary Given For 
				Chris Rohne, Civic, Church, Business Leader At Cranfills Gap</a></H5>	
					<P>Bosque County lost one of its most prominent and beloved 
					citizens on the levels of local, county, and state affairs last 
					week when Chris L. Rohne, aged 58 years, 5 months, and 12 days, of
					Cranfills Gap, died in his sleep on Wednesday morning, October 9, 
					at the home of his son-in-law and daughter, Mr. and Mrs. Joe 
					Eidson, in Fort Worth. </P>
					<P>Although Mr. Rohne had been in ill health and under a doctor's
					care for several years, it is understood that during the six 
					months prior to his demise he seemingly had regained his health
					and again was enjoying life to the fullest extent. The night 
					before his death, after a very pleasant day, Mr. Rohne went to bed
					in excellent sprites. His wife discovered his death the next 
					morning as the result of a heart attack. . . .</P>
					<P>Pallbearers were six of Mr. Rohne's nephews - Allen Bronstad and
					Walton Bronstad of Fort Worth, Oscar Knudson, of Carlsbad, New
					Mexico, Maurice Bronstad, of Denton, Wayne Arlen Rohne, of Austin,
					and Paul Christenson, of Cranfills Gap. . . . </P>
					<P>Youngest child of the four sons and five daughters of the late
					Evan Paulson Rohne and Mrs. Marianne Oleanna Egeberg Rohne, Chris
					Ludvig Rohne was born on April 28, 1899, in the boggy community
					between Clifton and Cranfills Gap at the homestead founded by his
					parents in 1880 and presently occupied by his brother and 
					sister-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. P. B. Rohne. </p>
					<P>Mr. Rohne's father died when he was two years of age, and his
					mother, truly a sturdy pioneer with a stiff back and stout heart
					was left alone to rear a large family and take care of a farm and
					business matters. Even as a two-year-old Mr. Rohne's sunny
					disposition and fun-loving spirit, which won for him so many 
					friends throughout the years, did much to while away lonesome and
					dark hours for his widowed mother.</p>
					<P>Baptized into the Lutheran faith in infancy by the late 
					Reverend J. K. Rystad, Mr. Rohne was confirmed in that faith on
					July 12, 1914, at the Old Rock Church and remained a faithful,
					conscientious, and devoted member or the Lutheran Church throughout
					his lifetime.</p>
					<P>Mr. Rohne devoted much time and effort to the affairs of the St.
					Olaf Lutheran Church at Cranfills gap, where he served as either
					Sunday School superintendent of teacher for 28 years. He also was
					president of a number of church auxiliary units and was instrumental
					in the growth and progress of the St. Olaf Church congregation and
					its building program. Many memorials to him were given for a piano
					or organ fund for the new St. Olaf Sunday School building, a fund
					which was begun following his death. The parsonage fund, which was so
					near and dear to Mr. Rohne's heart, also was remembered generously. </p>
					<P>He was often heard to say, "I hope we soon can build a nice new 
					parsonage for our preacher.: Usually when an idea occurred to Mr. 
					Rohne, he started work toward its realization; and the idea eventually 
					became an accomplished fact. Following his schooling in the Cranfills 
					Gap public Schools, Mr. Rohne attended Clifton College and Luther 
					College at Decorah Iowa.
					<P>On June 18, 1921, Mr. Rohne married his childhood sweetheart, Miss 
					Marie Bronstad, a daughter of the late Mr. and Mrs. G. O. Bronstad, 
					prominent residents of Cranfills gap. To their marriage were born three
					daughters, LoVerne (Mrs. Ray Schibler), Geraldine (Mrs. Joe Eidson), 
					and Marynell (Mrs. Wendell Wallace). Mr. and Mrs. Rohne were devoted to 
					one another and had a close, enviable marriage: he greatly loved and 
					enjoyed his daughters; and his five granddaughters were the price and 
					joy of his life.</p>
					<P>In the summer of 1920 Mr. Rohne became affiliated with the First 
					Security State Bank at Cranfills Gap, and three years later he was made 
					cashier of that banking institution, a position which he retained until 
					his retirement because of ill health in 1955. At the time of his 
					retirement Mr. Rohne also was vice president of the bank. He always was 
					mindful that he was a custodian of other people's money, a burden he 
					never took lightly.</p>
					<P>During Mr. Rohne's may years of service with the First Security State 
					Bank, he took a very active interest in the civic affairs of his 
					community, his country, and his state, as well as in church activities, 
					as previously mentioned. At one time Mr. Rohne also served as chairman of 
					the Fourth District of the Texas Bankers Association.</p>
					<P>In addition to his duties as a banker, Mr. Rohne was active in 
					ranching and conducted a life insurance agency representing among other
					companies, the Amicable Life Insurance Company of Waco for more than 30 
					years. His ranching interests stemmed from his desire to sponsor the 
					improvement of the livestock industry in his community and country. Only
					recently Mr. Rohne also was elected second vice-president of the Bosque
					Memorial Museum Association. He was proud of his Bosque County heritage 
					and had a great deal of knowledge concerning the county's early history 
					in his community. For many years he also served as Cranfills Gap 
					correspondent to The Clifton Record.</p>
					<P>Mr. Rohne had endeared himself to a large number of people throughout 
					the state because of his business and civic activities and had made many
					lasting friends in the banking profession. A man of kindness, tolerance, 
					and a keen intellect, Mr. Rohne was an able public speaker and had the 
					ability to get things done quickly and well. It always was to Chris Rohne 
					that folks turned when they needed something done at Cranfills Gap, and 
					it also was he whom his friends and neighbors sought when they required
					 advice.</p>
					<P>Mr. Rohne liked everyone and every animal, flower, and object of beauty 
					in this world. He carried no grudge toward any man and often said, " I do 
					not want to carry any grudges because  I want to go to heaven when I die."</p>
					<P>Left to survive Mr. Rohne are his wife, Mrs. Chris L. Rohne of Cranfills
					Gap: his three daughters, Mrs. Ray Schibler, of Gruver, Mrs. Joe Eidson, of
					Fort Worth, and Mrs. Wendell Wallace, of Pasadena; his five granddaughters,
					Marcia Schibler, 7, and Raye Dean Schibler, 3, of Gruver. Marilyn Eidson, 
					7, of Fort Worth, and Patricia Wallace, 5 and Pamela Wallace 2, of 
					Pasadena; two brothers, Reverend J. Magnus Rohne of Phoenix, Arizona, and P. 
					B. Rohne, of Star Route 2, Clifton; and three sisters, Mrs. G. S. Knudson
					(Pauline), of Cranfills gap, Mrs. C. T. Jenson (Emma) of Clifton, and Mrs. 
					J. Justin Jenson (Helen), of Baytown.</p>
					<P>In addition to his parents, Mr. Rohne was preceded in death by one 
					brother, Oscar Rohne, and by two sisters, Mrs. Minnie Mickelson and Mrs. 
					Cora Christenson.</p>
					<P>Chris Rohne truly will be missed in Bosque County where his mark was wide
					and sure, but he left each of us a well-trod path to follow. May we emulate 
					his efforts by furthering Bosque County and our individual communities in
					business, civic, church, and cultural fields.</p>
