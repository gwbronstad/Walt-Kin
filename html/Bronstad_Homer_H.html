<p>The "Fish Party" reported as going to San Saba in last week's issue, returned last Friday, with three hundred pounds of fish to their credit. In fact when they came home they had fish for everybody. Mr. G. O. Bronstad was reported to have caught the largest fish, but like all big fish do, it got away from him. Otherwise the party reports a complete success. . .</p>

<p>Among those who took the irresistible "fishing fever" and had to go to San Saba for the benefit of their health this week are: "Red" Tergerson, "Dutch" Torkelson, August Carlson, O. J. Bronstad, G. Larson, Martin Wollum, <b>Homer Bronstad</b>, Chas. Oscar Anderson, Louis, Ole and Bernt O Olson, Martin Dahl, Ole Wollum, M. Larson, J.T. Cox and Magnus Larson.

{From Wikipedia}<hr> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranfills_Gap,_Texas" target="_blank">Cranfills Gap</a> is a city located in Bosque County in central Texas, United States. It was founded by Norwegian Emigrants and to this day most residents can trace their lineage to those Norwegian Founders. The Bosque county area surrounding Cranfills Gap is listed on the National Register of Historic places as the Norse Historic District.[4] The population was 277 at the 2020 census.<br><br>
<b>History</b>
</p><p>
The area in which Cranfills Gap is located was originally settled by and named for George Eaton Cranfill in 1851.
</p><p>
Norwegian settlers in and around the community, who were mostly Lutheran, built St. Olaf Kirke (kirke is Norwegian for "church") in a rural area just outside Cranfills Gap. St. Olaf Kirke, commonly referred to as The Rock Church, is a small Lutheran church located in the unincorporated rural community of Norse, Texas. Among the pioneers in Norse was Cleng Peerson. The founder of Norse was Ole Canuteson (Ole Knudsen) from the Stavanger region of Norway. In 1917, as the congregation of that church began to grow, a new church was built for the congregation inside the town.[5]
</p><p>
The town slowly grew to its peak population of 600 in 1940. During World War II, Cranfills Gap was the first town to sell more than its quota of war bonds for the Fourth War Loan Drive. While as many as 25 businesses operated within "the gap", as locals commonly refer to it, the population and the business activity slowly dwindled to roughly nine businesses in 1980 and a population of 269 in 1990.

<h4>A Thousand Knudson Descendants Gather For August Reunion</h4>

<p>A thousand people, six generations of direct descendants of an immigrant from Norway, Salve Knudson, are making preparations for the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the arrival of the founder of the dynasty in America. They will come from all sections of the country for the reunion which will be held Sunday, Aug. 4, in the St Olaf Lutheran Church at Cranfills Gap. Present will be Tobias Knudson, 82, only living son of the founder.</p>
<p>The sermon at the church services Sunday morning will be preached by Rev. Jessie Knudson, one of the descendants, who is now a pastor in the panhandle. At that service a money offering will be received for the repair and upkeep of the old Rock church (Lutheran) near Cranfills Gap, where the founder and several of his sons lie buried.</p>
<p>Dinner will be served in the basement of St. Olaf church, followed by a program in the afternoon. At that meeting a money donation will be made to Clifton Junior College which one of the sons of Salve Knudson helped organize in 1896.</p>
<p>They'll Pay Honor To Hard-Working Pioneer</p>
<p>Primary purpose of the gathering according to P. G. Knudson of Waco and C. T. Knudson of Clifton, members of the committee in charge is "to pay honor to the hard-working, God-fearing pioneer Lutheran and his sons and to pass on to younger descendants the tales of hardship in the journey to America; cholera epidemics in east Texas, where the Knudson first settled; log houses and trouble with Indians in Bosque county and the development of the Norse community there to its status of the largest Norwegian settlement in the south, in which Knudsons played a major role.</p>
<p>Salve Knudson, who would have been 142 years old were he alive today, came to this county via Harve, France, on an American sailing vessel in 1846. Behind him in his native Norway he left the body of his recently deceased first wife and in Harve he left the body of his youngest daughter who died of measles during their eight-day stay there. With him came his second wife and his two sons, Knud and Oscar and his daughter Signe.</p>

<h2>G. O. Bronstad Bosque Pioneer, Passes Away.</h2>
<p>G. O. Bronstad, pioneer Bosque County citizen, died at his home at Cranfills Gap, Sunday, July 19, 1937, at about 1:45 p. m. Funeral services were conducted Monday afternoon at the St. Olaf Lutheran Church with interment in the St. Olaf Cemetery.</p>
<p>Mr. Bronstad was born March 9, 1856, in Romedal, Hedemarken, Norway. In 1874, at the age of 18, he emigrated to the United States, coming direct to Bosque County, Texas, where he joined his brother, C. O., at Valley Mills. Here in Bosque County he at once made his home and in due time adopted this country as his own. During his long life he has been an active and contributing citizen.</p>
<p>From 1874 to 1886 he lived successively at Valley Mills, Norway Mills and Morgan, engaging in business and learning merchandising. In 1886 he moved to Cranfills Gap, and opened his business concern in Cranfills Gap. Thus Mr. Bronstad successfully rounded out more than fifty years in business in this one location.</p>
<p>
In the land of his nativity he was baptized, and after proper training, was confirmed in the Lutheran Church. To this faith, confessed early in life, he remained true to the end.</p>
<p>This now departed highly respected citizen, lived a quiet, unassuming life, sincere in spirit, sympathetic, generous, and cheerful. In spite of severe experiences in business, he remained of sympathetic and kindly nature, giving service to his friends from far and near. All men were greeted with a smile in the Bronstad Store.</p>
<p>Due to the absence of his pastor, Rev. W. J. Maakestad, Rev. P. E. Thorson of Norse conducted the funeral services, assisted by Rev. O. T. Boe of Clifton and Rev. Farmer, Cranfills Gap. Inspiring music was furnished by St. Olaf Male Quartet, and by Mrs. Troll and Miss Knudson in a vocal duet.</p>
<p>Beside his wife, he leaves six children, Otis, Clyde, and Homer, Margaret, Mrs. C. L. Rohne and Mrs. Douglas Hudson. These all reside at Cranfills Gap except Mrs. Hudson, who lives in Holdenville, Okla. He is also survived by one brother, Otto, of Waco, and three sisters, Carrie and Syverine Bronstad of Waco, and Mrs Pernella Anderson, Clifton.</p>
<p>The large gathering of sorrowing friends and relatives that overflowed the spacious church was something of an indication of the high esteem in which Mr. Bronstad was held. Representatives from every section of Bosque County, from Hamilton and Coryell Counties, came to pay tribute to a good friend, a christian gentleman, an high-class merchant, a man.

<h3>Cranfills Gap School Will Open Monday</h3>

<p>Arrangements are rapidly being completed to open the doors of Cranfills Gap school Monday, August 30, to the largest enrollment in its history. This will be the first term that boys and girls of that section are to be offered a fully accredited high school convenient to them. The fact that all neighboring communities are to be represented in the student body is an indication that this school is accepted as a logical rural high school center for this section. The co-operating of all districts concerned is doing much to build a high school which will be among the best in the state.</p>
<p>Two new courses are to be offered this year. Bookkeeping will be taught to seniors and World History will be Tibet in the ninth grade.</p>
<p>The faculty for the year consists of the following: Superintendent and teacher of Mathematics, <b>Homer Bronstad</b>; Principal of high school and teacher of industrial work, Parks Windham; English, Mrs. E. B. Harris; Home Making and Business, Mrs. Clyde Bronstad; Principal of Grammar School and teacher of history, Ira Dahl; Coach of Boys' Athletics and teacher of seventh grade, A. J.

<h4>1938-09-02 </h4>
<p>Cranfills Gap School opened Monday, September 29 with a high school enrollment of 107 pupils. There were 188 enrolled in the grade school. The faculty for the school term is: First grade, Miss Mary Ellen Swenson; second and third grades, Miss Ruby Romine; fourth grade, Mrs Myrtle Ludwick; fifth grade, Mrs. Mina Dahl; sixth grade, Mr. J. Ludwick; seventh grade and principal of grammar school, Mr. A. J. Bailey; high school English, Mrs. Nora Harris; homemaking, Miss Mary Lewis Gowdy; industrial education, Mr. Ira Dahl; junior business and mathematics, Mr. Allen Ellington; commercial subjects and Principal of high school, Mr. Monroe Kruse; Superintendent, Mr. <b>Homer Bronstad</b>. Mr. Dahl Will coach the girl's basketball team and Mr. Bailey will coach boys' athletics.</p>
<p>The local school board has received the word that the WPA project for the erection of the new school building is being reviewed in Washington, D.C. All plans have been approved in Waco and in San Antonio. Approval by authorities in these two Texas cities means that the project is economically sound. It further means that architectural plans are satisfactory. Authorities in Waco were especially complementary after they had approved the project. Congressman W. R. Poage has pledged his support to the project and has become very active in helping to secure presidential approval. Congressman Clyde Garrett, who represents the Hamilton County section of our district, pledges his support in securing speedy approval. Although there will probably be several days before work can be begun, we feel that Cranfills Gap can rest assured that school term for 1939-1940 will be able to take advantage of this $49,000 improvement</p>
<p>Six buses carry the children to and from school this year. The bus drivers are: Jorgen Rohne, Boggy; Chris Christenson, Mount View; Carl Blum, Goar Valley; Rufin Knudson, Percival; Elvin Carlson, Mustang, Allen Ellingson, Meridian Creek.</p>
<p>We are proud of our school.

<h4>A Thousand Knudson Descendants Gather For August Reunion</h4>
<h4>America-fever Grips Sturdy Norse Farmer</h4>
<p>Salve had had "America fever" several years before he finally made the move. In 1848 he went so far as to sell his farm and all his goods at auction and prepared to leave, but then his wife became ill and died, leaving him with four children. Of these, the oldest, Knud, was later to lead the singing at the first Lutheran service to be held on Bosque county, and the son of another was to spend three months as a prisoner of Comanche Indians.</p>
<p>Not until three years later did Salve break his ties with Norway. In the meantime he had married again and was living on his wife's estate. On the trip to the coast where they were to get a boat for America, the children became ill with measles and they had difficulty in finding a place to stay until the boat came. No one wanted them. Finally he and several others who were headed for Texas to join a brother got a small boat for each and sailed to another Norwegian port, Kristiansand, where they made connections with a ship bound for Harve.[illegible]</p>
<p>They went by steam boat up the Mississippi and Red rivers to Alexandria, La., where the several families of immigrants had to stay three weeks in a three-room house because the water in the Red river was so low they couldn't ascend the rapids.</p>
<p>the six families got tired of Alexandria and were anxious to push on so they decided to buy horses and travel by two-wheeled wagons. Salve couldn't afford to buy a wagon after he had bought the horses for $25 apiece, but he had been a wheelright by trade and gad brought his tools along with him so he made a wagon entirely of wood--wheels and all.</p>
<p>On the overland trip salve and several others were made sick by drinking water from the Red river and Knud, a lad of 16 then, had to do the driving. Even though the river water made them sick, Salve had to have water to drink, so he reasoned that adding red pepper to a bottle of water would make it all right. They were bothered by Indians only once. That was when five or six bucks, already drunk, saw Salve take a pull from his bottle of peppered water. The redskins, thinking is was whisky, gave chase but Knut and other drivers didn't spare the horses and the Indians were outrun. Salve and company reached the Norwegian community of Normandy, southeast of Dallas, two months after they had left Alexandria.</p>
<h4>Six Families Live In One Second-Hand Home</h4>
<p>At Normandy, later named Brownsboro, they stayed with J. R. Reierson until they could find a home. Reierson had been encouraged by Sam Houston to induce Norwegians to settle. Some of his descendants are expected to be special guests at the Cranfills Gap celebration. They stayed there a year, four families in the main room and Salve's family and another in the kitchen.</p>
<p>Finding a house to live in was only one of Salve's worries. He had five mouths to feed and he was broke. He had spent $2 for his horses, $22 for two cows, $6 for a sow and a litter of six pigs, and he had 75¢ left To make matters worse, he could speak hardly a word of English. But he went out among the Americans at the nearest settlement, 15 miles away, and found work and Knud found work near home. For that they were able to buy some grain, and one of the cows-the other was dry-provided milk and butter. They had no meat but they could eat. The grain could be ground up in a mill of sorts which Cook had made out opt a tree stump and left. The crude mill was nothing more than a hole in the stump and pole to crush the grain.</h4>
<h4>Cholera Epidemic Hits Tiny Bosque Settlement</p>
<p>The immigrants managed to get through the winter but with the heat of summer came a cholera epidemic which struck down five members of the colony, including Salve's wife and his son, Oscar. There were no doctors and no medicine. Neither were there any undertakers. The stricken families had to get pine trees from the woods and split them into planks which they split them into planks which they sized and planed to make coffins.</p>
<p>With the coming of winter again health returned, the six families [illegible]

. . . son families--two of them now-- moved to Four Mile, near Athens [Texas</p>
<p>While they were still in East Texas, Salve and his wife had six children, two of whom died while they were young. The four others, Seri, Jacob, Tobias and Mollie, later moved with Salve and Knud's family to Bosque county, where Tobias still lives in the Mustang community near Meridian.</p>


<h4>Pastor Brings Sermons, People Follow Church</h4>
<p>Shortly after the civil war Rev. S. S. Reque of Wisconsin was commissioned to visit Texas and perform what religious duties he could in the Lutheran settlements. After ministering in east Texas he was brought by Knud Knudson to another settlement at Norse in Bosque county, about 10 miles northwest of Clifton. There he preached the first Lutheran sermon in that community in January, 1867. The singing was led by Knud, who fell in love with the hill country, reminiscent of Norway, and who induced many of the settlers in east Texas to move. He was aided by another cholera epidemic which killed 12 persons at Four Mile.</p>
<p>In 1868, 12 families, including Salve and his four children, Knud and his two children (another had died and was buried at Four Mile), made the 178-mile trip in ox-drawn wagons. Salve's and Knud's were home-made, entirely of wood, without the use of as much as one nail.</p>
<p>Salve and Knud each took 160 acres of adjoining land on Meridian creek, north of the Norse community. Salve's oldest daughter, who was born in Norway, had married Terry Nystel at Four Mile, and they moved to Bosque county the previous year. Since the trek from Four Mile to Norse, those three families have grown to number more than 350, all of whom are expected to have Representatives ant the Cranfills Gap gathering.</p>
<p>

<h4>Surviving Son Of Salve Knudson To Head Family Fete August 4</h4>
<p>In connection with the Knudson reunion on Aug. 4, the services before dinner and the afternoon program are open to the public. However, the barbecue dinner at noon is limited to members of the Knudson family only. Since there will be from 500 to 800 members of the family present it would be physically impossible to arrange to feed everyone who plans to attend the reunion.--The Committee.</p>
<p>When more than 1,000 descendants of Salve Knudson gather at the St. Olaf Lutheran church in Cranfills Gap Aug. 4 to talk over some 100 years of Texas history, only Tobias Knudson will be able to tell at firsthand of the hardships of pioneering among the Bosque County hills that reminded settlers so much of their beloved Norway.</p>
<p>Tobias is the only surviving son of Salve Knudson, who came to this country in the year Texas was annexed to the United States. Tobias is now 82, but with a keen and alert mind he still recalls his boyhood days and stories told him by relatives.</p>
<p>The celebration will take the form of a public worship in the morning, at which Rev. Jessie Knudson,one of the descendants, now a pastor in the panhandle, will preach. . . .</p>
<p>Knud, even though he was 31 years old and had two children, was swept into the Civil war and was captured by Yankee forces with the fall of Vicksburg in 1863. During the action around Vicksburg prior to the capture of that city he was saved possible serious injury by a handmade leather pocketbook. A shell struck his hip but was prevented from entering his body by the tough leather. The siege of Vicksburg was hard on soldiers and civilians alike, Knud told his relatives after the war, and before the surrender of the city hunger had reached the stage where rats were considered a delicacy.</p>


<h4>A Prisoner in the North</h4>
<p>
Knud sat out the rest of the war in a Yankee prison. Food was somewhat better then, he said, and rats were supplanted by horse steak, but he came out of the war with a distaste for sugar. That commodity was the only thing that was plentiful, and the prisoners were fed so much of it that he couldn't stand the taste of it since.</p>
<p>After the war Knud was released in February and returned home, making most of the journey by foot. He and his companions were halted temporarily buy the lack of boats or rafts to cross the Mississippi but they found a low spot and waded across. The water in places reached to their shoulders and when they reached the other side their clothing froze but they kept walking until it thawed out.</p>


<h4>Red Tape Stops Him</h4>
<p>A number of years after the war Knud applied for a pension, but he was stymied by red tape. He had enlisted as K. Knudson, and in applying for his pension he signed his application K. S. Knudson and was told that no record of his service existed. He didn't press the matter, for he didn't need the money and had intended to give it to the church if he got it.</p>
<p>Salve was too old to serve in the army during the war but he did his bi t on the home front by performing such badly needed activities as tanning leather and making shoes, tufting wool and making hats, and doing woodwork on bedsteads,tubs, buckets, churns and coffins.</p>
<p>The women, too did their share, (Knud's wife and children lived with parents during the war.) On one occasion a soldier returned to the community on 24 hour-furlough in a uniform that had about seen its last days. In that brief period the women of the community got together and spun thread, wove cloth and cut and sewed it into a new uniform for the lad, using only the buttons from the old one.</p>
<p>When the Knudsons moved to Bosque County in 1868 they weren't the first Norwegians in that community. Cleeng Peerson, a native of Norway who had a hobby of founding Norwegian settlements in America, led a little band into the area northwest of the present city of Clifton in 1853 and settled at what was later known as Norman hill. Peerson made numerous trips to Austin, some of them on foot,in the interest of the title claims for new settlers in the community and earned the name "King of the Norwegians" which was given him by state officials. The state legislature rewarded with a gift of 320 acres in Bosque County and he continued to live there until his death in 1865. He is buried in the cemetery at the Norse Lutheran church, the first Lutheran church in central Texas.</p>
<p>families came into Bosque County, some of them from east Texas, and by 1867 there were 22 Norwegian families in the colony.</p>
<p>Rev. S. S. Reque arrived in Texas from Wisconsin. He had been commissioned by the church to visit the Norwegian settlements and perform such religious services and duties as he could. He went first to east Texas and then, in January of the next year, he and Knud Knudson set out for Bosque County, the first visit there for both of them.</p>


<h4>Long Horseback Ride</h4>
<p>The 178-mile trip was made on horseback on saddles which Knud made especially tor the occasion. He used naturally forked wood covered with rawhide and again with home tanned leather. Both saddles eventually gave thousands of miles of service.</p>
<p>After Rev. Reque and Knud arrived in Bosque county the 22 families were summoned to the service by B. B. Swenson, then a lad of 16, who rode horseback around the community the day before the meeting. He later married Salve's daughter, Siri. The hymn singing at that service on the Jens Tingness farm was led by Knud. At the service steps were taken to organize a congregation. A monument built of cement, cobblestones and fossils marks the site of the service.</p>
<p>Rev. Reque remained three months and Knud returned to east Texas to sing the praises of the Bosque County hills which reminded him so much of Norway, and to urge settlers to move westward.</p>
<p>But Knud met with opposition from an unexpected source--his wife. For hardly had he returned to east Texas than word came from Bosque County that Ole Nystel, his 14-year-old nephew and the son of Salve's daughter Signe, had been captured by Comanche Indians.</p>
<p>

Ole had been helping a neighbor, Carl Questad, chop poles in a cedar brake in the hills north of their homes when a roving band of Comanches struck Ole ran but was captured after an arrow had pierced his right leg. Questad escaped by jumping from a small bluff while the Indians were occupied with the boy.</p>
<p>The lad was taken on horseback to the Indians' home in Kansas. The trip lasted three weeks and for the first nine days he was given nothing to eat. En route they captured a negro and drove a knife into his chest, killing him, and forced the boy to laugh at the sport.</p>
<p>Several of Ole's attempts to escape were balked by the Indians, but after they had him for three months they held a council and decided he was giving them so much trouble that they might as well turn him in for a government ransom. They took him to a trading post near Smoky Hills, Kansas, operated by Eli Sewell, and after some bickering the price was set at $250, to be paid in brown paper, blankets, tobacco, flour and sugar.</p>
<p>Sewell wanted to adopt the youth but Ole was determined to return to his parents. The Indian agent, Colonel Leavenworth, reimbursed Sewell for the ransom and Ole made the return trip with a government supply train and ox wagon and part of the way on foot to Milford, where he was taken sick. Three days later he met some friends from Bosque County and returned home with them.</p>
<p>Knud's wife was adamant. She just wasn't going to move to a place where they would have to maintain eternal vigilance against the Indians. But there was one thing she dreaded even worse than redskins, and that was cholera. Another epidemic struck the little east Texas community , claiming 12 victims, and she gave in.</p>
<p>Twelve families made the move, the two Knudson families traveling by hand-made ox carts constructed without the use of nails. The furniture they took with them also was hand made by salve.</p>
<p>When they reached Bosque County salve and Knud each pre-empted 160 acres of adjoining land near meridian creek. Until they could build log cabins they camped under an oak tree (which is still standing) in a lean-to made of some lumber they had brought with them from east Texas.</p>
<p>The Knudsons settled down to lead quiet, unassuming lives as farmers in Bosque County. They were not forward and aggressive but played leading roles n organizing churches and schools in the community and in the development of the county.</p>

<h2>Bronstad Gap Superintendent 1935 — 1939</h2>

<p>The first superintendent chosen by the trustees for Cranfills Gap as a reorganization movement began in 1935 was Mr. <b>Homer Bronstad</b>. Mr. Bronstad graduated from the Cranfills Gap school in 1926. He atÂ­tended Clifton Jr. College for two years before beginning his public school career at the Boggy School in 1928. He spent two years as teacher and principal at Boggy, after which he moved to the Coyote School for the 1930-31 school term. In 1931 he moved closer to home for a teaching position in the Mustang School. He held this position for four years unÂ­til assuming the superintendency at Cranfills Gap.</p>
<p>Mr. Bronstad had continued his education during his early school career. He received his B.A. degree in math from the University of Texas in 1934. He would later receive his M.Ed. degree from the University in 1949 to continue another phase of his wide ranging: education experience.</p>
<p>When Mr. Bronstad accepted his job with the Cranfills Gap School in 1935 there was already a movement in progress to bring students from ther rural districts into larger consolidated district which could Provided a more varied and comprehensive educational program. During the period from 1935 to 1939, Mr. Bronstad was faced with the task of opening up the Cranfills Gap School to students from neighboring rural systems, developing a transportation system, providing, and negotiating the web of legal requirements necessary to legally consolidate existing common school districts in to the new Cranfills Gap Rural High School District.</p>
<p>When Mr. Bronstad left Cranfills Gap in 1939, the Cranfills Gap School District included all or part of the former districts of Mustang, Boggy, Meridian Creek, Live Oak, and Harmony from Bosque County and Mt. View, Goar, and Percival from Hamilton County. Bond issues had been passed and construction was underway on the new high school and gymnasium.</p>
<p>These projects did not come about without conflict among the commuÂ­nities and people involved. The community was fortunate to have the services off a superintendent who was able to mediate and negotiate the school district through this difficult period. It was because of the the success during this four year project that the school in Cranfills Gap was able to grow and secure its role in the area for the years to come.</p>
<p>Even though Mr. Bronstad had moved onto another position before completion of the building program, his name has its rightful place on the cornerstone of the high school building.</p>
<p>From 1939 to 1943 Mr. Bronstad served as superintendent of the -Blanket High School District. In 1943 he returned to Cranfills Gap to enter business. After service in the Navy in 1945, Mr. Bronstad returned to business in Cranfills Gap. This period was important to the direction his future in education would take.</p>
<p>In 1947 Mr. Bronstad again entered the education field as a disÂ­tributive education coordinator at Vernon, Texas. Mr. Bronstad wrote his Master's thesis at the UniversiÂ­ty of Texas on the distributive eduÂ­cation branch of vocational education. The year 1951 found him in the Denton Public Schools workÂ­ing in his chosen field of distribuÂ­tive education. He was later employed as a consultant by the Texas Education Agency in the field of distributive education with Texas schools from Texarkana to Killeen and Brownwood to Vernon in his service area. Until his retirement, Mr. Bronstad remained in Denton as the Texas Education Agency Consultant for the D.E. program. During this period he also wrote manuals and curriculum materials for the Texas Education Agency in the area of distributive education.</p>
<p>Since his retirement in 1971, Mr. Bronstad and his wife Travis have enjoyed traveling, civic and club acÂ­tivities, the new found hobby of phoÂ­tography, and the joy of pride in their three sons and eight grandÂ­children.</p>
