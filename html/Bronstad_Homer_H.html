<h2>Bronstad Gap Superintendent 1935 — 1939</h2>

<p>The first superintendent chosen by the trustees for Cranfills Gap as a reorganization movement began in 1935 was Mr. Homer Bronstad. Mr. Bronstad graduated from the Cranfills Gap school in 1926. He atÂ­tended Clifton Jr. College for two years before beginning his public school career at the Boggy School in 1928. He spent two years as teacher and principal at Boggy, after which he moved to the Coyote School for the 1930-31 school term. In 1931 he moved closer to home for a teaching position in the Mustang School. He held this position for four years unÂ­til assuming the superintendency at Cranfills Gap.</p>
<p>Mr. Bronstad had continued his education during his early school career. He received his B.A. degree in math from the University of Texas in 1934. He would later receive his M.Ed. degree from the University in 1949 to continue another phase of his wide ranging: education experience.</p>
<p>When Mr. Bronstad accepted his job with the Cranfills Gap School in 1935 there was already a movement in progress to bring students from ther rural districts into larger consolidated district which could Provided a more varied and comprehensive educational program. During the period from 1935 to 1939, Mr. Bronstad was faced with the task of opening up the Cranfills Gap School to students from neighboring rural systems, developing a transportation system, providing, and negotiating the web of legal requirements necessary to legally consolidate existing common school districts in to the new Cranfills Gap Rural High School District.</p>
<p>When Mr. Bronstad left Cranfills Gap in 1939, the Cranfills Gap School District included all or part of the former districts of Mustang, Boggy, Meridian Creek, Live Oak, and Harmony from Bosque County and Mt. View, Goar, and Percival from Hamilton County. Bond issues had been passed and construction was underway on the new high school and gymnasium.</p>
<p>These projects did not come about without conflict among the commuÂ­nities and people involved. The community was fortunate to have the services off a superintendent who was able to mediate and negotiate the school district through this difficult period. It was because of the the success during this four year project that the school in Cranfills Gap was able to grow and secure its role in the area for the years to come.</p>
<p>Even though Mr. Bronstad had moved onto another position before completion of the building program, his name has its rightful place on the cornerstone of the high school building.</p>
<p>From 1939 to 1943 Mr. Bronstad served as superintendent of the -Blanket High School District. In 1943 he returned to Cranfills Gap to enter business. After service in the Navy in 1945, Mr. Bronstad returned to business in Cranfills Gap. This period was important to the direction his future in education would take.</p>
<p>In 1947 Mr. Bronstad again entered the education field as a disÂ­tributive education coordinator at Vernon, Texas. Mr. Bronstad wrote his Master's thesis at the UniversiÂ­ty of Texas on the distributive eduÂ­cation branch of vocational education. The year 1951 found him in the Denton Public Schools workÂ­ing in his chosen field of distribuÂ­tive education. He was later employed as a consultant by the Texas Education Agency in the field of distributive education with Texas schools from Texarkana to Killeen and Brownwood to Vernon in his service area. Until his retirement, Mr. Bronstad remained in Denton as the Texas Education Agency Consultant for the D.E. program. During this period he also wrote manuals and curriculum materials for the Texas Education Agency in the area of distributive education.</p>
<p>Since his retirement in 1971, Mr. Bronstad and his wife Travis have enjoyed traveling, civic and club acÂ­tivities, the new found hobby of phoÂ­tography, and the joy of pride in their three sons and eight grandÂ­children.</p>
