    <p>Embrey''s Fatther, William Twyman Walton, was part of a long line of Americans. </p>
<br>
    <p>Embrey''s Mother, Ethel Irene was of a moderately long line of Americans </p><br>
    <p>Embrey was Louise’s only surviving brother. Frederick had died in childhood in a farming accident May 1915. Louise depended on Embrey in a number of ways. After Louise’s first husband,  Marshall Holbrook died in 1933, Embrey helped her invest Marshall’s life insurance guarantee in a Fort Worth rental house where he could manage rent and maintenance while she carried on with her professional life in in one of the few professions then permitted to a woman. Teachin-g in public schools. Texas, rural texas. </p><br>
    <p>The rental cushioned the rough patches that a single mom endured getting undergraduate college credentials to secure future teaching positions in first one rural school after another. (Eulogy, Buffalo Gap, Shive, Cranfills Gap, Keller). Eventually the rental property was sacrificed to grease the transition from rural Cranfills Gap into Urban Fort Worth (where Embrey lived.)</p><br>
    <p>Where indeed, for a while, my father, Clyde lived. Shared upstairs domicile with another of Embrey’s Brother-in-Laws, Eugene Ragsdale.

<blockquote class="pww">A couple of stories I remember him telling. The first was how he, aged 3 or 4, climbed up on the roof or windmill tower and would not come down till his mom made him French fried potatoes.  I think he wrote that down but not totally sure.

The other was how he started playing piano. He said the girls [Aubrey, Annie, Louise and Ina Jo] got to go take lessons. He realized they got out of farm chores. So he told his dad that he wanted to play piano too.

<blockquote class="gwb">Walt Bronstad’s relation with Uncle EMBREY
<br>&nbsp;<br>
He led the way, doing what so many men, women and children have done in the industrial age, make the difficult transition from rural to city life. One assumes he had aid, guides, friend or familial relations to ease the transition from the familiar to the strange. I can only guess.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
	But for Clyde, Louise, Bette and me, your Father, Embrey was decidedly important.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
	Long before I was born, Embrey helped Louise invest some of her deceased first husband’s (Marshall Holbrook died in 1933) life insurance in a Fort Worth rental house. Louise cashed out in 1954 to help fund the buying of 4710 E Loraine.

	Beginning 1948 and into 1951, Clyde had tried to make a go of the family grocery store in Cranfills Gap. Declining rural populations, some returning WW II vets who wanted to run competing stores, and improved transport to larger towns made Clyde’s mercantile efforts unprofitable. 
<br>&nbsp;<br>
	Clyde had throughout his life worked in other capacities in other locations, but bringing a family along to a new job for a 55 year old man was no simple task. In August of 1951, Clyde began work at Carswell AFB, based on his skills as an aircraft mechanic. He rented room from your Father in the upstairs of the College Ave house. Pansy’s brother, Eugene Ragsdale, rented there too.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
	Once the Cranfills Gap school year was over, once Clyde’s job was secure, Clyde’s family moved to a rental house on Bedell Street, a block or so off Hemphill. I was not happy losing familiar friends and familiar surroundings. I was just old enough to be a serious impediment to the process of settling in to new quarters, so Mother shipped me off for a week with Bronstad relatives in Denton.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
	To me, Embrey was over–the–top avuncular. He gave me the first job I had as a child in Fort Worth, delivering life insurance advertising circulars. (Uncle Embrey had lost his job with an oil firm because he had lost most of his vision to a detached retina. He could keep bills paid selling insurance, reading by holding text up to his face. There was no Social Security Disability coverage until 1956.) For me the job  experience let me learn urban navigation in south Fort Worth.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
	Once Clyde’s family moved to Haltom City, and I began school, the anonymity of urban social life alarmed my mother. One domestic bogeyman of the times was <u>juvenile delinquency</u>. Louise, conferring with Embrey, directed me into the <u>Tarrant County Junior Deputy Sheriffs</u>.  The directors of this organization must have assumed we were all latent criminals. During one Saturday training we were shown the inside of the Tarrant County Jail and fingerprinted – for real- while assuring us the we-and-they were on the same side with the authorities. It's a little discomforting to recall that 16 years after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristallnacht" target="_blank">Kristallnacht</a>, we, <u>Junior Deputy Sherrifs</u> wore black uniforms, marchhed in formation, had rifle and martial arts training. Oh well, the bivouac into the Davy Crockett National Forest was fun.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
	Years later, Embrey and I traveled to the Walton family home place near Hamilton, TX many times in the mid '50's. (This was after grandfather William Twyman Walton ceased to be adequately connected with reality; grandmother Ethyl Walton never learned to drive a car and needed help controlling her diabetes.) I was in his car giving him vision security since he really did not belong on the highway and had a higher risk of getting injured or lost, but he had no better alternative. Once on the farm I might assist or drive a tractor, but never mix the white arsenic and coarse ground grain he spread to fight insects eating his crops.
	<br>&nbsp;<br>
	He gave me the first car I ever had. Unfortunately it was a tubercular '36 Chevy and I was an ungrateful whelp, ill equipped to fix it to drive-able status, unwilling to drive a pre-war car to high school. I did not fulfill the illustrious pattern that Embrey Junior had, ten or 12 years earlier, given a car in need of repair.
	<br>&nbsp;<br>
	Mid high school years, Embrey employed me again to paint the 3730 College Avenue house. This was a challenge for me. I wasn’t happy with heights, (the College Avenue house was two story with high pitched gables) or narrow and doubtful ladder footing.twixt Pansy’s flower bed, narrow walk-way and the low walled driveway.
	<br>&nbsp;<br>
 Pinched twixt cowardice and necessity, I gradually intuited the properties of an extension ladder. This intuitive understanding did good service in dealing with vectors in physics and mathematics.
 <br>&nbsp;<br>
During undergraduate years, ‘59 - ‘63, Mother made me aware that Embrey wanted to remarry. I spotted a likely prospect among my college professors. Luckily for you, (Emily and Paul) my match-making enterprise never found a voice: Embrey had already taken notice of a young lady out east.  The professor must have decided my interest in her calves was not academic. This had altogether innocent but profound consequences for me. But that would only bore you and embarrass me to go further.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Well into adulthood, Embrey again employed me, after I’d crashed to ground at the end of my academic dream. I along with one of Bette’s friends, whom I only remember by nationality; he was Costa Rican.  The Costa Rican and I spent several nights on Embrey’s recently purchased property, adding a length of barbed wire fence. The purpose of the fence now escapes me.  You may imagine the pay was not large. After I subtracted the cost of renting a post-hole auger and gasoline to and from Fort Worth, and split the remainder. I feared Bette’s friend would think I cheated him.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
All during my life in Fort Worth and later when my children were young, it was obvious that Embrey played a central role in family cohesion. The family of William Twyman Walton. Will’s children spread across the country:  Aubrey was in Fresno, California, Annie Joy in Wichita Falls, Louise in C gap then Fort Worth, Ina Jo in Odessa. Grandmother, Ethel (Embrey) Walton rotated among her children  even before William Twyman’s death. Much of the glue holding those sibs together came in multi-copy letters from Embrey’s typewriter.

   <H4>Obituary of <a id="BeulahsObit">Beulah Walton</a></H4>
<P>Beulah Woody Walton departed this life on July 23, 2019. Beulah was born the seventh of ten children of Wyatt William and Loucreta Wise Woody in Kalmia, North Carolina on April 26, 1925. She grew up during the Great Depression around Hawk, a Cane Creek community, in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Western NC. Beulah graduated from Bowman High School in Bakersville, NC in 1942. Soon after graduating high school, she went to work for an ordnance company in Kingsport, TN supporting the war effort until the end of World War II.</p>
<P>After the end of the war, Beulah worked several jobs that would keep her near her home and her parents. In 1949, she decided to attend King's Business College in Charlotte, NC. She was hired by the Department of the Navy in 1951 and moved by herself to Washington DC. In the late 1950s, Beulah met her future husband, William Embrey Walton. They were married in October of 1959 and she moved to Fort Worth, TX. They had two children Emily and Paul. The family attended Travis Ave Baptist Church where her husband was a long time member.</p>
<P>Beulah continued working for the Federal Government in Fort Worth and eventually started working at General Services Administration. She retired from her position with GSA in 1987. She started working for Colonial Cafeterias as a server in 1977 and continued into the 1990s, when she fully retired.</p>
<P>Beulah was a caring and loving mother who did everything she could to promote her children. Her hard work helped to put Emily and Paul through college. When her first grandchild Lauren arrived, Beulah proved to be an even more caring and loving grandmother. Her four grandchildren were the world to her. In her later years she had two four legged companions that provided her with a lot of company. Beulah remained living in her own home until 2017. She spent her final years at the Mirabella Assisted Living Facility in Fort Worth.</p>
<P>Beulah is survived by her daughter, Emily and her husband, Brad Minnich; her son, Paul and his wife Susan Walton; her grandchildren: Dr. Lauren and her husband Dr. Matthew Evans; Rachel and her husband Trent McGee; Wyatt Walton; Laramie Walton; her great grandchildren: Alewen Evans; Ellery Evans; Elizabeth Mc Gee; her brother Fred Woody; and her sister Betty Buchanan. Donations can be made in lieu of flowers to the Alzheimer's Association or the Humane Society of North Texas. She will be buried at St. Olaf Kirke Cemetery, near Cranfills Gap, TX.</p>
