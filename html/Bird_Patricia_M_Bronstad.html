<p> Patricia dealt with her illness with denial. In her last five or so years, it was unclear just what she understood. I feared she might wonder, "why is Walt saying these things, am I about to die?" Instead of solace, I might leave terror.

<p>Pat's obituary ran in the <a href="https://www.statesman.com/obituaries/paco0638761">
      Austin American Statesman 
    </a>and the Ft Worth 
      Star Telegram</p>
    
        <p>Patricia Bronstad, a 40-year resident of Austin, drew her last breath on Nov 6, 2023, surrounded by family in the Knoxville, Tennessee home she shared with her husband, Walt of 63 years. She had suffered from frontotemporal dementia since 2016.
        </p>
       <p> We miss her friendship, kindness, and generosity. She had a beautiful smile and a self-deprecating, mischievous sense of humor. She loved books, films, museums, chocolate, Willie Nelson, Lady Longhorn basketball, and cats. She frequently traveled with her husband, her friend Paulette Gravois, and others. She was an adventurous cook of wholesome food and of decadent desserts. A daily jogger, Pat was often running Austin’s Town Lake Trail. She ran the Capital 10k for nearly 30 years.
      </p>
       <p> Born January 30, 1941 in Fort Worth to Jeff and Clara Bird, the second youngest of sixteen children, she attended Birdville (Haltom City) public schools, graduating from Birdville High with honor in 1959. She wed Gilbert (Walt) Bronstad February 24, 1961.
      </p>
        <p>Pat received a BA in Sociology from UT El Paso. Following her peripatetic husband, she also attended Eastern Michigan University, University of Illinois at Chicago, University of North Texas, and Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand.
        </p>
        <p>Pat worked for UT Austin from the 1990s until 1/31/2008. Her last position was Information Analyst in the College of Natural Sciences. After retirement she toured North America, Europe, and Asia.
        </p>
       <p> A longtime poll-worker and volunteer for Meals-on-Wheels in multiple cities, Pat was a caring community member.. She regularly supported Planned Parenthood, Habitat for Humanity, and Doctors Without Borders.
      </p>
        <p>Her children Kate, Kris, and Matt; grandchildren, Millie and Harriet “Birdie” Bronstad-Hay; and daughters-in-law Jessica Brilli and Jessica Hay cherished her and glowed in Pat’s love for them.
        </p>
        <p>If you wish to make a gift in her memory, make a contribution to one of the charities mentioned, or simply buy a good novel for someone you love.
        </p>
        <p>A memorial service will be held near St Olaf’s Cemetery, near Cranfills Gap, TX. February 3, 2024. For details, please email pat.b.memorial@gmail.com
