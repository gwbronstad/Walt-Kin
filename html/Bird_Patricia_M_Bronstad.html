<blockquote class="Cr2"><img class="mlr"  src="../pic/Pinky/Birds/f-WaltBronstad-pinky.png" alt="Walt Bronstad">- By Walt Bronstad-- &nbsp;I never had the pleasure of meeting Jeff Bird, but Clara and I got to know each other well. Several times, while I dated Pat, Clara had me over for dinner. - If I was to continue dating her daughter, I needed more scrutiny.
 <br><br>
Pat reasurred me that not all 15 siblings plus wives and children would be there, just a simple Sunday dinner. I'm introvert so Clara, Buster, Mary, David and Betty were formidable enough. I knew David and Bette from Birdville High School, David and I took the same plane geometry class. Buster the Marine, was a bit more intimidating.
<br><br>
Pat and I wed 1961-02-24; of course Clara was there for the ceremony as well as David and Earl. Two and  half years later, Pat and I lived in a studio apartment in Ann Arbor. By that time, Earl and Nancy occupied the Meadow Oaks home, Clara came on the train for a visit. The apartment was cramped for two, Clara did not stay many days.
<br><br>
in 1972, Pat gave birth to Philip Matthew. The new Mother needed a little guidance in child rearing, and who better than the Mother who gave life to 16? Clara stayed considerably longer that visit in Michigan; she had more to impart. Almost certainly, Philip, as we knew him then, was the greatest beneficiary.
<br><br>
After the girls, Kate and Kris  were born, Clara came too, along with Potsy and Sissy.

She showed me several of the homes he had modified with an architectural flare. In fact when Earl and his family took over the Meadow Oaks home, Earl made the house his own, altering the front, changing the street appearance.
<br><br>

When we married, Pat and I, both her Father, Jeff, and her oldest brother, Eddie, were gone. Thus it was Earl, who gave his sister Patricia away in marriage; Patricia‘s mother Clara, relied on Earl as the eldest male of the family.

<blockquote class="Cr2"><img class="mlr"  src="../pic/Pinky/Birds/f-WaltBronstad-pinky.png" alt="Walt Bronstad">- By Walt Bronstad-- &nbsp;Evelyn Bird was Polly. Most of the birds, especially the older ones had nicknames. These were the first names I learned of the family. 
<br><br>
Polly helped us many times in our lives; six months of my life we spent in Aberdeen Proving Ground Maryland. Pat and her mother Clara drove in the bat-wing,'59 Chevrolet from Fort Worth to Alexandria, Virginia or where Polly, Kirk, Kinney, and Terry Linton lived. Pat stayed with the Linton family for the six months of my OCS training. During that six months, Pat worked in an army depot; this was quite helpful. The army enlisted men allotment of four sets of fatigues was woefully inadequate for the demands of OCS.  Little by little Pat increased my wardrobe to 16 sets and sewed on the emblems.
<br><br>
16 years later, our family of five, Pat, Matt, Kate and Kris and I, stayed with the Linton’s for one night. To go to New Zealand, we had to interview at the New Zealand Embassy in Washingtonn, D. C.; presumably they wanted to ensure that we didn’t have an extra head.

Throughout the years she welcomed us many times to her home at 2245 Grace in Fort Worth. Frequently she fed us Sammie's Bar-B-Q. Often she sent us home with more Bar-B-Q and a half-gallon of Sammie's sauce. So important to them was Bar-B-Q that she and Sammie had a pit built close by their home.
<br><br>
During our last month in Austin, when Patricia was well into marked symptons of her dimentia, Margaret, accompanied by her daughter Sherry Anderson and her niece Rebecca Utley visited us at 1406 Briarcliff. The next day, in Fort Worth, Margaret died. Margaret's funeral at Mount Olivet was the last time Pat walked among her birth family and members of her extended family.

<br><br>
While I was a student Pat was very lonely I think and I didn’t have a way of realizing it. While a co-op student. I was either working at Chance Vought by day and going to night school at Arlington State College in the evenings and working homework or, Saturday night, working at the Star Telegram. While full-time student, I was attending ASC classes and burying my head in the books or working again at the Star Telegram Saturday night. So weekend visit to Potsey and Dick's house kept Pat in touch with Family. Albert and Vera lived aat 860 Patti Drive, almost behind Dick and Potsey, it was convenient for them to visit too.
<br><br>
By this time, Earl may have acquired the Meadow Oaks home. Clara may have begun her perigrinatons amongst her more established daughters, not really sure of Clara's chronology, but Pat's Mother may have been enjoying the hospitality of her older daughters.

<br><br>
Much as I apreciated their warm, familial intent, I had to work out of my depression in my own way.

Carlton (Buster) was ever a Marine. Early in the new millenium, he was collecting subscription money  for <u>The Marine Times</u> in a dodgy Dallas neighborhood. Two men backed up their demand for his collection by flashing pistols. Buster's, "I don't think so.", earned him two near fatal bullets and days in a Dallas hospital.

Ironically, Buddy seemed not overly concerned with material prosperity. He seemed more in tune with his Father who wanted a lot of kids.
<br><br>
Rita, who grew up in Keller, TX, fondly remembered my Mother, Louise who taught at Keller 1952 - 1955?

<br><br>
Many times, after our marriage, Pat and I visited with Sissy and Jerrol Shivers at their 5817 Dana Drive home. They were very supportive, Sissy gave us a large round coffee table and a durable drum table that toured the world with us to the antipodes, to Portland, OR and to our several homes in Austin.
<br><br>
Jerrol who was alergic to inertia helped me construct a front step handrail for my Father's home, this became evidently important after my Uncle Hudson took a painful tumble exiting my father's home.

In the 1980's, when Clara became ill and needed specialized care, Mary and Jimmie organized and managed the family response. I cannot begin to do their accomplishments justice.

When we lived in Austin, the Jenson family moved to Kerrville, TX, a two hour drive from Austin, so we visited often. In the 90's we even took a trip together to Copper Canyou in Mexico.

<p>I wrote this 2003-10-31  {Walt on Patricia}. I don't think I ever showed it to her. The moment never arrived; the poem lay buried in my waneing web site. Duaghter-in-Law Jess encouraged me to say to the bedridden, aphasic, Paticia all the things I'd never said. </p>
<p> Patricia dealt with her illness with denial. In her last five or so years, it was unclear just what she understood. I feared she might wonder, "why is Walt saying these things, am I about to die?" Instead of solace, I might leave terror.

<p>Pat's obituary ran in the <a href="https://www.statesman.com/obituaries/paco0638761">
      Austin American Statesman 
    </a>and the Ft Worth 
      Star Telegram</p>
    
        <p>Patricia Bronstad, a 40-year resident of Austin, drew her last breath on Nov 6, 2023, surrounded by family in the Knoxville, Tennessee home she shared with her husband, Walt of 63 years. She had suffered from frontotemporal dementia since 2016.
        </p>
       <p> We miss her friendship, kindness, and generosity. She had a beautiful smile and a self-deprecating, mischievous sense of humor. She loved books, films, museums, chocolate, Willie Nelson, Lady Longhorn basketball, and cats. She frequently traveled with her husband, her friend Paulette Gravois, and others. She was an adventurous cook of wholesome food and of decadent desserts. A daily jogger, Pat was often running Austin’s Town Lake Trail. She ran the Capital 10k for nearly 30 years.
      </p>
       <p> Born January 30, 1941 in Fort Worth to Jeff and Clara Bird, the second youngest of sixteen children, she attended Birdville (Haltom City) public schools, graduating from Birdville High with honor in 1959. She wed Gilbert (Walt) Bronstad February 24, 1961.
      </p>
        <p>Pat received a BA in Sociology from UT El Paso. Following her peripatetic husband, she also attended Eastern Michigan University, University of Illinois at Chicago, University of North Texas, and Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand.
        </p>
        <p>Pat worked for UT Austin from the 1990s until 1/31/2008. Her last position was Information Analyst in the College of Natural Sciences. After retirement she toured North America, Europe, and Asia.
        </p>
       <p> A longtime poll-worker and volunteer for Meals-on-Wheels in multiple cities, Pat was a caring community member.. She regularly supported Planned Parenthood, Habitat for Humanity, and Doctors Without Borders.
      </p>
        <p>Her children Kate, Kris, and Matt; grandchildren, Millie and Harriet “Birdie” Bronstad-Hay; and daughters-in-law Jessica Brilli and Jessica Hay cherished her and glowed in Pat’s love for them.
        </p>
        <p>If you wish to make a gift in her memory, make a contribution to one of the charities mentioned, or simply buy a good novel for someone you love.
        </p>
        <p>A memorial service will be held near St Olaf’s Cemetery, near Cranfills Gap, TX. February 3, 2024. For details, please email pat.b.memorial@gmail.com
