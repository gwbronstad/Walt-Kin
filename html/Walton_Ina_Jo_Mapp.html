<blockquote class="Cy2"><h4>&nbsp;<img class="mlr" src="../pic/Pinky/Embrey-pinky.png" alt="picture Embrey Walton">&nbsp;W. E. WALTON FAMILY</h4>
[I spe]nt most of the first quarter, Twentieth century, in Hamilton County. I had diptheria during babyhood and Dr Jas [?] administered toxin-antitoxin; [?]dly the first used in the county. 
[?]v buildings erected on the square [?]e square paved by a huge horse-[powered] rock crusher. There were phonographs-and motorcycles before electric [lights and] indoor plumbing, telephones, w[indow] screens were commonplace. [fin]ally cars, then trucks, replaced bug[gies and h]acks, surreys and wagons; then gas [station]s and garages superseded livery [stables] and blacksmith shops. Roads were [improv]ed consistently.
<br><br>
[I was]thrilled by the first railroad from [Gates]ville: awed by dynamite blasts and [bridge]s as more tracks were constructed [between G]atesville and Comanche. Soon after [the las]t track was built, a big rain washed [out a s]mall bridge a few blocks north of the [Hamilt}on station. The first rail worker fatal[ity the] first car-train death in the county, I [?]  happened within two miles of my [?]bd home.
<br><br>
Haley's comet was a familiar sight in [the night.] I wondered if I might see its next [appear]ance (due 1986). A one-day excur[sion to] Waco's Cotton Palace was exciting. [The fir]st airplane I saw was piloted by [?]n Stinson during a carnival picnic [?]ly. Circuses in the fall were interest[ing, fi]shing and hunting, when it was too cold for field work, play at school [ and so]metimes a family picnic, constituted [most o]f our recreation.
<br><br>
[Som]etimes from home, a few miles [north] east of Hamilton, a heavy pall of [smoke]from four cotton gins, two cotton [seed o]il mills, a compress, flour mill, etc. [gave th]e town an industrial appearance, or [warne]d us for an approaching "Blue Norther".
<br><br>
[We] were thrilled by music of visiting U.S. [Army] and plane training flights after war [was d]eclared, April 1917. We rejoiced in [the ar]mistice celebration in 1918 and then [were s]addened within the next few months by many flu deaths.
<br><br>
[In th]e fall of 1918 we could see light from [a bur]ning oil well near Desdemonia, [in Coma]nche County. Soon many giant [wood]en derricks sprang up in the county [?]e in oil searching - no concern for [?]en. The wonder of radio followed [quickly.]
<br><br>
[On] May 5, 1915, the tragic death of my [broth]er. Frederick, age five, distressed us [esp]ecially my parents. One consolation [was i]n the words of King David, "I cannot [bring] him back but can go to him". Little [thought] now that forty-two years later I would [lose th]e only son I had at that time, Embrey. [?]nd again be consoled as before plus [grant]ded assurance gained through years of Bible study.
<br><br>
[Aft]er fifty-two years in Fort Worth, Hamil[ton is still "Home". My parents were Wm and Ethel Walton. My first wife and I had three children, Janetha. Embry. Jr. and Nan.  Alter my tirst wife's death I married Beulah and we have Emily and Paul. All five have enviable records of which I am very proud. I also have four grandchildren and [?]great-grandchildren. I have four sisters, Aubrey, Annie, Louise, and Ina. W. E. Walton.

<h4>1915-05-14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Child [Frederick Walton] Meets Tragic Death </h4>
<p> An accident which resulted in the instant death of Frederick Walton the little five year old son of Mr. and Mrs. Will Walton of Blue Ridge, occurred Wednesday afternoon at about 3:30 o'clock near the residence of W. O. O'Bannon, four miles from Hamilton.
<br><br>
The little boy was riding in a wagon in which his uncle, Tom Walton, was hauling a hay press. The child was standing near the press, when an upright lever caught in a low telephone wire, toppling over the press. It is supposed the child jumped from the wagon, the press falling out of the wagon on him, crushing him to death instantly.--<u>Hamilton Herald</u>. </p>
<blockquote class="Cy2"><img class="mlr" src="../pic/Pinky/Walt-pinky.png" alt="picture Walt Bronstad">&nbsp;&nbsp;Grandfather Will Walton said of him,"We knew Fred was uncommon, he was always pleased with whatever we gave him or did for him. We had expecrted great things of such a disposition, but now he is gone."<br><br>The pain of this loss struck not only parents, siblings, Aunts and Uncles; the pain has become part of the patrimony of the next generation. <br><br>
Mother took care that I, as a child, then later as an adult visited <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/19979160/frederick-cook-walton" target="_blank">Uncle Frederick's grave</a><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i>.

<h4>1924-10-03&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <b><u>Hamilton Herald-Record</b></u></h4>
<p> W. T. Walton, one of Hamiltor county's best citizens and a prosperous farmer, was a pleasant business caller in the Herald-Record office last Saturday afternoon. While here he informed us that his daughter, <a href="Walton_Annie_Joy_Walton.html" target="_blank">Miss Annie Walton</a> had returned to John Tarleton College in Stephenville for her last year in that institution. <a href="Walton_Aubrey_Gilkes.html" target="_blank">Miss Aubrey Walton</a>, who graduated from Tarleton last spring, will teach with her brother, <a href="Walton_William_E.html" target="_blank">Prof. Embrey Walton</a>, in the Shive school this year. This family of young folks are ambitious and are attaining to great usefulness in their school work, and a legion of friends wish for their continued success and happiness.</p>
<blockquote class="Cg2"><img class="mlr" src="../pic/Pinky/Walt-pinky.png" alt="picture Walt Bronstad">&nbsp;&nbsp;This man was "bustin his buttons" with Fatherly pride. Wouldn't suffice to simply talk up his children to the fellows on the Hamilton courthouse square, or congenial congregants of his church. Nothing less than the entire literati in the reach of the <u>Hamilton Herald</u> would do. <br><br>
And it <u>was</u> quite an achievement for each sibling; homework hours were sandwiched between farm chores and the limited availability of kerosene lamps and oil for night reading light.<br><br>
And it <u>was</u> an achievement for Will and Ethel who could afford to send each child to school and continue to run the farm with a declining family work force.

 <h4>1924-12-05</h4>
<p>A lovely little daughter,<img class="mlr"  src="../pic/Pinky/JanethaJune-pinky.png" alt="picture of Janetha June"> Janetha June, has since December 5, been basking in the joyous love of her young parents, Mr and Mrs. W. Embrey Walton, who are at home this winter in Shive where the proud young father is principal of the school. The happiness of the young parents cannot be measured and all of their hosts of friends hope that their blessed companionship with the little daugter may grow in happiness as she develops into the various ages of childhood and after a while into womanhood, beautiful, gracious and pure.  --  W. E. Walton</p>

Claibourne had to change church to Church of Christ to close the deal.</p>
<blockquote class="Cg2"><img class="mlr" src="../pic/Pinky/Walt-pinky.png" alt="picture Walt Bronstad">&nbsp;&nbsp; Well after Will's death in 1957, when the land was being divided among the siblings, Mother and I drove on the gravel road within the "ranch", land Will had used to graze cattle. It's an undulating section of land, covered in grass and live oak trees. At the 'top' of the section were rude shelter and feeder troughs. 
<br><br>
WIll would feed the cattle frequently throughout the week; that let him check on his cattle, to see if any were injured or in calf and other such work of stockmen. The road hugged the fencelines, wherever terrain and live oak clusters permitted, so as to ease the job of checking and fixing the fences. 
<br><br>
But that day, Mother crept slower than usual along the rough rutted road, seeking Claibourne's shack. It took Claibourne long, isolated nights of wrestling with his soul before he could find a way to meet Leone's demand to change to her family's church.
<br><br>
At the time, I inferred Claibourne had built a retreat shack, but after having read Grace (Embrey) Eubanks account of James Monroe Embreys settling near Hamilton, " Later there were other small houses done on the ranch near Bear Creek--moving closer to town each time they were built", I now infer Claibourne squatted in an abandoned house/shack.
<br><br>
Regardless of the theological choices consequences on Claibourne's soul, it's a damned good thing Claibourne made the choice he did for the sake of Winston and Cynthia Dawn Walton.

Two boys and four girls were born to Ethel and Will Walton, married in 1901. Of five survivors, I am the third daughter. Those early years on a farm find many of my memories pastoral related.
<br><br>
I recall walking two miles to Blue Ridge School through fragrant pastures in spring past blazing sumacs or yellow-green broomweeds in their final fling in fall, and stopping once to skate on Grisham's tank in winter. With the icy wind at our backs, we stepped on the tiny, brittle, lacy, ice covered roadside pools to hear the tinkling sound. Later we attended East Ward and high school in town, riding in a buggy or surrey with hot bricks at our feet in winter.<br><br>
Much deference was given academic achievement and hard work; rarely did the latter preclude school attendance. The thrust of our purpose was adherence to spiritual values. Music was important.<br><br>
Some happiest times were singing around the piano. My father said every man should sing at his work, and truly my parents said their frustrations, exultations, joys, and faith in songs.<br><br><hr>
My first husband lost his life accidentally shortly after our son, Bobby, was born. We moved to Cranfills Gap in 1934. The road there from Hamilton, which we often made, was dusty and crooked. Once, Bobby, then four, getting out of the car to investigate a signal of trouble, and anticipating mechanical opportunities, clapped his hands and jubilantly cried,<br><br>"O Boy, look, Mommy, a flat!"
<br><br>
Clyde and I were married while he was in the grocery business and I was teaching.
Our two children were born at Cranfills Gap.<br><br>
Bobby was attending Texas Wesleyan College when we moved lo Fort Worth. After finishing, he worked as a tool designer, going later to Wisconsin. There he married Charlotte Munger; they have three children, Terri, Rex, and Mark. He is working for American Can.
<br><br>
Walton attended the Universities of Texas and Michigan. He lives in Austin with his wife, nee Pat Bird, his son, Matthew, and twin daughters, Kate and Kris.
<br><br>
Bette spends her extra time and cash traveling; she is getting another degree in Engineering.
<br><br>
Clyde, now eighty, still embellishes his fascinating stories of early life of Hamilton and Bosque counties
<br><br>
We still walk over grasslands where my grandfather J. M. Embrey, nearly a century ago had hundreds of sheep west of Hamilton.
<br><br>
The creek still runs part time that cooled my mother's feet and furnished mud to relieve her bee stings as she helped her father. Depressions remain where massive rocks were removed to build structures in town. Recently we found a fossil gastropod under a massive oak where my mother had played.
<br><br>
We still see the wild flowers coloring the pastures. The blue bells, winecups, Indian blankets, and paint brushes are still there.
We see the cedars clutching the hillsides, the oak clusters cleared goat-high, the willows with thirsty roots crowding the streams as we travel near Hamilton.
These pictures and memories I treasure.  Louise Bronstad

 <h4>The Walton‘s family garden scarecrow.</h4>
<br>
Big Whitey had hardly crowded his shrill “cock-a-doodle-doo“ from that stout leghorn neck when William Twyman Walton opened his big blue eyes and bounded to the floor, exclaiming "Gosh-o-landin', Ethel, like brother Barret would say, I should have been up an hour ago.
<br><br>
One of Will's chief delights was to relate a humorous incident or one that evoked pleasure. So he smiled to himself as he anticipated the day's plowing, while lighting the kindling and wood in the cook stove as he listened intermittently to the "potrack" of the guineas and gobble of the turkeys, hoping that some noise from Ethel, Embrey, Aubrey, Annie Joy, Louise, or Ina would announce other awakenings.
<br><br>
He reminisced about the cattle drives that he and other cowboys made to Kansas market a few years ago.
<br><br>
While filling the kettle with water for oatmeal, he proceeded to grind fresh coffee beans in the grinder that was attached to the wall. During this time, he continued to drop just as many pans and pots as possible to arouse the family. When these clatters failed to awake anyone except Ethel, he recited in his unmistakable loud tenor voice, the little Irish poem;
<ul style="list-style-type:none;" class="cursivelarger">
<li>"Jackie and Jennie </li>

<li>they lived in the rye,</li>

<li>They had a little baby, </li>

<li>with one black eye.</li>

<br>
<li>Jennie" said Jackie, </li>

<li>'let's knock it in the head.'</li>

<li>'No Jackie,' said Jennie, </li>

<li>'let's buy it some bread.</li>

<br>
<li>You buy it one loat,</li>

<li>and I'll buy it two, </li>

<li>We'll bring up our children, </li>

<li>like other folks do.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
Poems pleased the children. Hearing Papa sing or recite poetry early in the morning meant that he had not been lately too upset by some unpleasant incident, as a pole cat absconding under the back porch, or some similar happening.
<br><br>
When the usual chores such as lunch fixing were completed, the four older children loaded into the surrey. The son, Embrey, who was the oldest, was in the driver's seat, with his feet braced tight against the buckboard. Will gave him the usual admonition to "look after the girls" as Old Mark, the faithful old buggy horse scurried down the lane past the O'Bannons', Brother Tom Walton's, the Stuckeys' and Browns' on the way to school.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Ethel finished pounding the dasher in the wooden churn for fresh butter and remarked to Ina, the youngest daughter, that today they would take a broom and some old clothes out to the upper garden to make a scarecrow. This would frighten those pesky birds from the English peas, lettuce, and radishes. Tar Baby, Ina's black puppy, tagged along behind Ethel and Ina as they dressed up the old broom into a staunch and distinctive scarecrow.
<br><br>
Will hitched his mule team of Beck and Moodin to the nearest fencepost when he drove into view of the grotesque figure standing there, and armed with his horse-whip, decided to investigate. Imagine the jovial occasion his discovery afforded!

No man in  my experience showd more genuine concern for the feelings, the respectful treatment of others, than <mark>Ernest Mapp</mark>. As a child, I could see his efforts to instil those values in his children. Like the instance when he reproached Dick, (monosylabically, "DICK!") for Dick's verbal response to me that one could interpret as insufficiently respectful of my feelings. Similarly, years later there was one "LYNDA!" My chidren could fairly reproach me for not doing nearly so well for them.

<h4>1990-06-23 &nbsp; &nbsp; William Ernest "Dick" Mapp II dies.</h4>
<p>W. E. Mapp Jr. Odessa &mdash; W. E. "Dick" Mapp Jr., 51, died Saturday at his residence.
</p>
<p>Services will be at 10 a.m. today at Crescent Park Baptist Church with Masonic graveside services in Sunset Memorial Gardens. Arra gements were made by Hubbard-Kelly Funeral Home.
</p>
<p>He was born March 11, 1939, in Odessa, and was owner of Dick Mapp Tank Supply, Inc. He was a member of Odessa Masonic Lodge No 955, Scottish Rite Free Masonry and the Odessa Chuckwagon Gang.
</p>

Dick was special to me as a child; it seems he was special to everyone in the extended family, adult or child. He introduced me to a lusty appetite for life. Quite early we decided he should wed Bette and I Milynda. We didnt think it germane to consult their thoughts on the matter. In Cranfills gap we explored parts of the surrounding countryside I never would have alone. What with oil field tank bolts and match heads transformed into grenades, explorations of fireworks joined with gasoline and other ideas that were better left silent, it's a wonder we saw our twenties.
<br><br>
I'd last seen Dick at Father's Funeral, at St Olaf's Cemetery near Cranfills Gap, December 28, 1989. I was shocked to see him trailing an oxygen bottle; he said he was not doing well. He seemed all but an imposter; my image of Dick Mapp was of a man of robust vitality. Scion to the well established Mapp Tank Company, Father of four sons. He'd been to Norway with the Chuck Wagon Gang, exploring business opportunities wiwth the North Sea oil drilling. 
<br><br>
Living my own life, I'd not appreciated the economic blow that changes in the petroleum industry had dealt his oil field servicing company, and indeed Odessa itself. I was unaware that like me he was troubled by asthma, but in his case much worse.

It would be a delightful treat to have a card, letter, call, or visit from you. Have been at this pleasant place (Retirement center) but every day I think of you and hope you will find time to let me hear from you &ndash; or better still to have a visit from you. 
<br><br>
Talked with Bette and Embrey a few days ago and was hoping to hear from them. Also &ndash; I have heard from A. Joy [Annie Joy Walton] and JJ [Janetha June (Walton) Dunahoe] lately. But it is so lonely without Ernest, Dick and Milynda [Mapp] that I catch myself wanting to hear from you  folk and other kin
<br><br>
Hoping all is well with you. Tell me about your family and Homer and Travis [Bronstad] and their family.
<br><br>
PS. I have a 2 bedroom apartment, so would lobe to have you stay overnight or longer.
Lots of love, IJM

Dear Wally &amp; Famiy,
<br><br>
Thank you again for your thoughtful, newsy letter, I needed that. Joe's [Joseph Michael Mapp] wife and daughter have left him and Larry Dons [Edwards] wife has left him on a trial separation. I cannot hear from any of them to say nothing about worrying about little Christopher LDs &amp; Js baby son.
<br><br>
But having had your letter and having a call from Bobby [Holbrook] recently has really helped pull me through.
<br><br>
This is a nice place and I enjoy being here near the church, with school teachers I taught with and having the good food where they serve us with special attention to diabetics
<br><br>
I have talked with Lena and Helen [Hawkins] lately and have had a letter from Everett Blackwell &amp; Nell Strickland (Uncle Barrett (Papa's brother) grandchildren.[)]
<br><br>
Thought you or your children might like the Clifton paper clipping about your mother &amp; daddy's wedding. You probably have one but I thought perhaps you children might like one. 
<br><br>
It would be wonderful to have you visit &mdash; or call or write. &mdash;
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p>IJM</p>
PS Pray that the estranged ones get counseling.
<br><br>
I also get reports from Janetha June [(Walton) Dunahoe] about Ruth [Walton] and have had a letter from Winnifred Embrey Knight

By  November, 1993, <mark>Aunt Ina Jo</mark> had lost her Husband, Ernest, 11 years earlier,  her only son, Dick, 3 years earlier, and her adopted daughter Milynda 8 months earlier to suicide; only one sibling, Annie Joy remained.  Ina Jo was the baby of the family. Older siblings had younger, living siblings to help with their grief. Ina Jo had considerably less support; it was a bitter price for marrying a man 11 years her senior.
<br><br>
In past,she supported her extended famiy when she could. She gave mother hand-me-downs; she gave me Dick's hand-me-down shirts (a few with velvet and cowboy snaps that earned me a few quizzical if not admiring glances from Junior High girls.) She and Ernest employed my brother, Bob when he needed money for college. The Mapps bought a home in Hamilton so she and her siblings could more easily help their isolated Mother, Ethel, after their Father, Will, had to have supervisory care in the mid '50's. She more than any other aunt or uncle boosted my spirits in OCS, sending a huge box of cookies. For two or three days, I got enough calories.

Wally,
<br><br>
Do you suppose you could make me a copy of Whitter <u>Barefoot Boy</u> that is more readable and more concise than this copy? I need it for my  collection of favorite poems. If <u>Thanatopsis</u>, &ndash;<u>The Village Blacksmith, Annabel Lee</u> (Poe) and the poem that begins <u>Tell me not in mournful numbers &ndash; Life is but and empty dream"</u> &hellip; are easily accessible &ndash; I would appreciate copies of them &ndash; also Dunbars <u>'Specially Jim</u> &ndash; "The goblins will get you if you don't watch out"</u> &ndash;<u>Between Two Loves.</u> No rush about any of these &ndash; unless it is <u>Specially Jim</u> &mdash;
<br><br>
We have monthly birthday parties and may need <u>'Specially Jim</u>.
<br><br>
How are you people? What is going on down that way except a swolen river? Are the children involved in camp or other activities?
<br><br>
Bills &amp; Ts [Bill and Tamara Mapp] children are going to church camp. This paper is atricious [back side of daily calender] But I do not know where other paper is.
<br><br>
So nice to have a call from Bobbie [Holbrook] the other day.
<br><br>
Would Bette &amp; E [Bette and Embrey Brostad] come out for a week end do you suppose. What else would I have to do besides "Kick the bucket" for them to come?
<br><br>
How do folks down there like Gov. Bush?
<br><br>
A.J. [Annie Joy Walton] won't come to see me even if I tell her Sheets clinic here  has a famous eye bank (You know she has only 1 eye) She says she must go back to Duncanville to see <u>her</u> Dr and see what he says.
<br><br>
Do write sometime please.

Dear Wally and Family,
<br><br>
Am enclosing this with a copy of Aunt Grace's [(Embrey) Eubanks] letter that she wrote to me back in 1972. I can't get Bette to answer this a.m. &ndash; (only her machine) hence I don't know where I stand  with trying to get this and probably Carl Rice Embrey's letter (recent) photograph and sent to you &ndash; (and probably Bobby [Holbrook])
<br><br>
But I am hoping you get this and if I have already sent you once, pleas excuse.
<br><br>
Know you enjoy having Embrey close to you there [Embrey Bronstad stayed with us one semester she took at UT Austin.]
<br><br>
Enjoy looking at the photographs you sent some time ago.
<br><br>
Am here at Arlington Dell Wood Plaza&ndash; on 6801 Poly Webb Road. Come to see me when you are here. May have eye surgery (cornea) October 8th with a 95 % chance of recovery &ndash; but may have waited too long.
<br><br>
But anyway &ndash; I hope for the best.
<br><br>

<br><br>
P.S. Carl Rice [Embrey] will have a book written about him &amp; his paintings near Hamilton near Ambrose's and has achieved international fame.

Helen died in her sleep after a brief illness (Kidney infection) in hospital. I gather it was a considerable surprise, Shelby had the impression she was getting better, almost ready to be discharged from  hospital. She had been a school principal as well as a teacher. <br>
My Mother, Louise (Walton) Bronstad felt a special joy at the mention of Helen's name. She and  Helen were double cousins; geneticaly that's as close as siblings are. The two were separated by only two years in age.

<b><u>The Odessa American</u></b>,  (TX) - Sunday, January 20, 2002

<p><i>First cousins share one pair of grandparents</i>; <u>double cousins share four grandparents</u>. Having the same four grandparents in common, defines the relationship "double cousin".</p>
<hr>
<p>
Double cousins are not a rarity, at least not in the earlier Walton Family. Janetha June (Walton) Donohue notes in her work from the Pearl Webb Cemetery, Canmer, KY: "T. D. Walton is Thomas Dandridge Walton and he was a brother of Wm. C. Walton. His wife, Susan, was a sister to Wilhemina Wood." There were 8 surviving children in the Wm. C. and Wilhemina (Wood) Walton family; There were 4 surviving children in the <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/about/L41P-DDW" target="_blank">Thomas Dandridge Walton</a><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i> and <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/about/L41P-DX9" target="_blank">Susan Virginia Wood</a><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i> family, making for a set of 12 double cousins which included Will and James. The relationship appears to recede into the past like a fractal pattern. Almost certainly the double cousin relationship is older than written history.
