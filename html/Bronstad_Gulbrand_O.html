<blockquote class="Cr2"><img class="mlr" src="../pic/Pinky/Walt-pinky.png" alt="picture Walt Bronstad">&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the data for these tables comes from Robert Hunter Sturtevant's private publication: <u>DESCENDANTS OF OLE ANDERSON BRONSTAD</U>, September 1,1999 update. Robert married Mary Ann Powell, a granddaughter of Great Uncle Otto Olson Bronstad. Robert deserves high praise for his scholarly work. I've used it for many hours over the years.<br><br>
My scholarly limitations leave me perplexed by some of the data. Looking at the birth locations for my Great-grandfather, Great-grandmother, Grandfather, Great-aunts and Uncles, I can validate the identities and locations of parishes, Romedal and Vang, less than 20 miles apart, (many a man has gone further looking for a bride) and the now outdated county, Hedemark, currently combined with Oppland into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innlandet" target="_blank">Innlandet</a> county. But 19<sup>th</sup> century locations within parishes, do not have a ready internet identity that I can find. E.G. <i>Borstad</i> within Vang Parish, <i>Sagbakken</i>, within  Romedal Parish. These "place names?" probably will never be translated into something like <i>"15 Nj&aring;rds Veg"</i> a digital address. Old identities are sometimes sacrificed to digital expedience. These place names are italicized in respect of their ephemerality.
<br><br>"<i>Kirkenaer</i>" is a cautionary case. One can find "Kirkenaer" in Norway, but it is not in Romedal parish, The "Kirkenær" that Google finds is the administrative centre of Grue Municipality, 35 miles distant from family activity in Romedal. This must be another case of a name (like Church or Riverside or Washington) being used for many different locations.

<h4>Romedal</h4>
Romedal is a former municipality in the old Hedmark county, Norway. The 385-square-kilometre (149 sq mi) municipality existed from 1838 until its dissolution in 1964 when it became part of Stange Municipality. The administrative centre of the municipality was the village of Romedal where Romedal Church is located. Other villages in Romedal included Ilseng and Starhellinga. The municipality centered around the agriculture and forestry industries.
History
<br><br>
The parish of Romedal was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the municipality of Romedal (population: 6,441) was merged with the neighboring municipality of Stange (population: 9,734).
Name
<br><br>
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old Romedal farm (Old Norse: Ruðmudalr) since the first Romedal Church was built there. The first element is (probably) the genitive case of an old river name (Ruðma). The river name may have come from the word ryðja, which means 'clear' or 'empty'. The last element is dalr, which means 'valley' or 'dale'.<br>

<blockquote class="Cr2"><img class="mlr" src="../pic/Pinky/Walt-pinky.png" alt="picture Walt Bronstad">&nbsp;&nbsp; So the old identities are tricky. Romedal is no longer a municipality. And good luck finding Hedmarken County. The old counties of Oppland and Hedmark merged to become the County of Innlandet 1 January 2020.

   <h2>A Norwegian immigrant makes his way in the world.</h2>
   <h3>My Uncle Homer provides some of the earlies parts of Gulbrand O Bronstad's story.</h3>
   <p><mark>Gulbrand Olson Bronstad</mark>  was born March 9, 1856 in Romadal Hedemarken, Norway. In 1874, he emigrated to United States and came direct to Valley Mills where he spent some time with his brother Christian.</p>

<p>From 1874 to 1886 he lived at Valley Mills, Norway Mills, Waco and Morgan during which time he learned to speak English and had a variety of business experiences.</p>

<p>At Morgan he met Morris Wiel, bookkeeper for Miller merchandising Store. In 1887 Miller went bankrupt and Bronstad and Wiel formed a partnership, bought the bankrupt stock and moved it to Cranfills Gap where they set up a general merchandising store. After a short time in the business, Wiel decided to go back to Germany, leaving Bronstad as the sole owner of the store..</p>

<p>On November 30, 1893 he was married, to Laura Hansen, daughter of Jurgen and Petra Foss Hansen, who lived near the Rock Church, the corner stone of which was laid in 1886. The wedding was the "talk of the town", as Bronstad had been an eligible bachelor, it would be very interesting to know how many buggies, hacks and surreys were at the hitching post on that day..</p>

<p>To this union were born six children. Otis married Selma Tergerson. He was his dad's partner. Later, he was Postmaster in Cranfills Gap. Clyde married Louise Walton. He worked in Bronstad's Store for several years and later worked in Waco and Fort Worth. Marie married Chris Rohne. She also worked in the store until she married. Lorine married Douglas Hudson in Oklahoma. She was a nurse. Later she assisted him in their funeral business. Homer married Travis Knudson. He was a teacher, principal, superintendent and later a consultant for the Texas Education Agency. Marguerite lived at home with her parents. She helped her mother cook and do the household chores. There was often a guest or two besides the family at meals.</p>

   <h3> The <u>Clifton Record</u> (a Bosque County, Texas weekly newspaper) recorded the comings and goings in quiet neighboring areas like Cranfills Gap; all the better to increase readership beyond Clifton, TX. I mined microfilm of the <u>Clifton Record</u> for family references. Most noticeable for Gulbrand were his advertisements for his store. Additionally, I saw slimmest images of Gulbrand's past, much as one might see, passing a wooden fence, a kinetoscopic view of a neighbors back yard.   </h3>

<h2>Our [Editor of Meridian News] First Visit to Cranfills Gap.</h2>

<p>. . . The people of Cranfills Gap know just how to treat a fellow to make him glad he is living in such a country; that spirit of hospitality was in evidence with every person we met.</p>

<p> We found the immense mercantile establishment of <mark>G. O. Bronstad</mark>  doing a regular city rush of business; also the drug store of Colwick & Cooper in a splendid new building and the stock up-to-date and the business in a thriving condition.</p>
<p> . . .The new bank building for that little city was to be started this week and rushed to completion when it will be opened and run by the thriving citizens of that place; and we were very glad to learn that our old friend John L. Huse, who is at present bookkeeper for <mark>G. O. Bronstad</mark> , had been honored with the Cashiership, as he will make a good one, and a man that has already by his sterling quality and honest dealings won the confidence and admiration of that people. </P>

<blockquote class ="wiki">From Wikipedia<br>( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_immigration_to_the_United_States )<br>
<h4>History of immigration to the United States</h4><br>About 1.5 million Swedes and Norwegians immigrated to the United States within this period [1850-1930] because of opportunity in America and poverty and religious oppression in the united Sweden–Norway. That accounted for around 20% of the total population of the kingdom at that time. They settled mainly in the Midwest, especially Minnesota and the Dakotas. Danes had comparably low immigration rates because they had a better economy[citation needed], but after 1900, many Danish immigrants were Mormon converts who moved to Utah.
</blockquote>
<hr class="green3r">
<blockquote class ="wiki">From Wikipedia<br>( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Americans )<br><h4>19th century</h4>

Many immigrants during the early 1800s sought religious freedom. From the mid-1800s however, the driving forces behind Norwegian immigration to the United States were agricultural disasters which led to poverty, from the European Potato Failure of the 1840s to the Famine of 1866–68. The agricultural revolution also put farmers out of work and pushed them to seek employment in a more industrialized America.
<h4>Religious migration</h4>

The earliest immigrants from Norway to America emigrated mostly for religious motives, especially as members of the Religious Society of Friends or as Haugeans. To a great extent, this early emigration from Norway was born out of religious persecution, especially for Quakers and a local religious group, the Haugeans.
<h4>Cleng Peerson</h4>

Organized Norwegian immigration to North America began in 1825, when several dozen Norwegians left Stavanger bound for North America on the sloop Restauration (often called the "Norse Mayflower"). Under the leadership of Cleng Peerson, the Restauration left Stavanger in July 1825 and ferried six families on a 14-week journey. The ship landed in New York City, where it was at first impounded for exceeding its passenger limit. After intervention from President John Quincy Adams, the passengers moved on to settle in Kendall, New York with the help of Andreas Stangeland, witnessing the opening of the Erie Canal en route. After making the journey to Kendall, <mark><mark>Cleng Peerson became a traveling emissary for Norwegian immigrants and died in a Norwegian Settlement near Cranfills Gap, Texas in 1865.</mark> </mark>  The descendants of these immigrants are referred to as "Sloopers", in reference to the sloop ship that brought them from Norway. Many of the 1825 immigrants moved on from the Kendall Settlement in the mid-1830s, settling in Illinois and Wisconsin. These "Sloopers" gave impetus to the westward movement of Norwegians by founding a settlement in the Fox River area of Illinois. A small urban colony of Norwegians had its genesis in Chicago at about the same time.
Organized immigration
<br><br>
While about 65 Norwegians emigrated via Sweden and elsewhere in the intervening years, no emigrant ships left Norway for the New World until the 1836 departures of the Den Norske Klippe and Norden. In 1837, a group of immigrants from Tinn emigrated via Gothenburg to the Fox River Settlement, near present-day Sheridan, Illinois. It was the writings of Ole Rynning, who traveled to the U.S. on the Ægir in 1837 that energized Norwegian immigration, however.

Throughout much of the latter part of the 19th century and into the 20th century, a vast majority of Norwegian emigration to both the United States and Canada followed a route commonly shared by most Swedish, Danish and Finnish emigrants of the period, being via England by means of the monopoly established by the leading shipping lines of Great Britain, primarily the White Star Line and the Cunard Line, both of which operated chiefly out of Liverpool, England.[ These lines negotiated with smaller 'feeder lines', primarily the Wilson Line, which was based out of the port city of Hull on England's east coast, to provide emigrants with passage from port cities such as Christiania (present-day Oslo), Bergen and Trondheim to England via Hull. Steamship companies such as Cunard and White Star included fares for passage on these feeder ship in their overall ticket prices, along with railroad fares for passage between Hull and Liverpool and temporary accommodations in numerous hotels owned by the shipping lines in port cities such as Liverpool.
<mark>&hellip;</mark> 
Between 1825 and 1925, more than 800,000 Norwegians immigrated to North America—about one-third of Norway's population with the majority immigrating to the U.S., and lesser numbers immigrating to the Dominion of Canada. With the exception of Ireland, no single country contributed a larger percentage of its population to the United States than Norway. Data from the U.S. Office of Immigration statistics of the number of Norwegians obtaining lawful permanent resident status in the U.S. from 1870 to 2016 highlights two peaks in the migration flow, the first one in the 1880s, and the second one in the first decade of the 20th century. It also shows an abrupt decrease after 1929, during the economic crisis of the 1930s.

<blockquote class ="wiki">From Wikipedia<br>( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleng_Peerson )<br><h4>Cleng Peerson</h4> (17 May 1783 – 16 December 1865) was a Norwegian emigrant to the United States; his voyage in 1824 was the precursor for the boat load of 52 Norwegian emigrants in the following year. That boat load was a precursor for the main wave of Norwegian immigration to the United States.
<br><br>
He was a Norwegian-American pioneer and "Slooper" who led the first group of Norwegians to emigrate to the United States, traveling on the Norwegian sloop Restauration. 
<h4>Background</h4>

Cleng Peerson was born Klein Pedersen near the community of Tysvær in the county of Rogaland, Norway. His parents were Peder Larsson (1755–1841) and Inger Sjursdotter (1744–1814). Cleng Peerson grew up on the farm Hesthammar in Tysvær, but was born on the farm Lervik in the same district. In 1821, he first traveled to the United States at the request of a religious community in Stavanger. This community was made up principally of Quakers, together with Haugeans, both groups having been influenced by the beliefs of German Rappites.
<h4>Immigration</h4>

In 1824, when Peerson came back to Norway, it was decided that a group should emigrate. Peerson returned to America to prepare for their arrival. Cleng Peerson met the immigrants when they landed in New York on October 9, 1825. They moved to northern New York, settling about 35 miles (56 km) northwest of Rochester in the town of Kendall, near Lake Ontario, in Orleans County. The road that ran through this settlement is today known as Norway Road.
<br><br>
In 1834, Cleng Peerson led a group of settlers to a little settlement on the Illinois River, in the Fox River Valley. The community of Norway in LaSalle County, Illinois is the site of the Norwegian Settlers Memorial which was dedicated in 1934.
<br><br>
Starting in 1838, Peerson returned to Norway several times. By 1840, Peerson had settled in Sugar Creek in Montrose Township, Lee County in the southeastern part of Iowa. Cleng Peerson was listed in the United States census records as a settler in 1840. He lived here for several years, including the period 1840–47. In 1847, he joined the Swedish immigrant society at Bishop Hill Colony in Henry County, Illinois, which had been founded by sect leader Erik Janson.
<br><br>
<mark><mark>During 1854, the Texas State Legislature granted Peerson 320 acres (1.3 km2) of land west of Clifton, in Bosque County, Texas. Peerson lived here until his death in 1865 and was buried in the cemetery by Our Savior's Lutheran Church in Cranfills Gap.</mark> </mark> 
<h4>Personal life</h4>

Peerson married the Swedish-born widow Ane Cathrine Saelinger (1749–1831) in 1807. He later married Maria Charlotta Dahlgren (1809 – ca. 1849) who had emigrated from Sweden in 1846.
<h4>Legacy</h4>

    In 1947 and 1975, Cleng Peerson was featured on Norwegian postage stamps.
    During 1982, King Olav V of Norway visited Texas in recognition of the 200th anniversary of the birth of Cleng Peerson.
    Cleng Peerson Research Library and Cleng Peerson Institute are both located in Clifton, Texas.
    Tysvær municipality has announced plans for the Cleng Peerson Center.
<br>
<h4>In literature</h4>
The True Saga Of Cleng Peerson are novels written by Alfred Hauge (translated by John Weinstock and Turid Sverre. foreword by Carl W. W. Sorenson. Special Projects Committee, Norwegian Society of Texas; 1982) about the life and times of Cleng Peerson. The three volume series were published in Norwegian between 1961 and 1965 by Gyldendal Norsk Forlag.

<blockquote class ="wiki">From Wikipedia<br>( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I)<br>World War I or the First World War (28 July 1914 – 11 November 1918), also known as the Great War, was a global conflict between two coalitions: the Allies (or Entente) and the Central Powers. Fighting took place mainly in Europe and the Middle East, as well as in parts of Africa and the Asia-Pacific, and in Europe was characterised by trench warfare; the widespread use of artillery, machine guns, and chemical weapons (gas); and the introductions of tanks and aircraft. World War I was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, resulting in an estimated 10 million military dead and more than 20 million wounded, plus some 10 million civilian dead from causes including genocide. The movement of large numbers of people was a major factor in the deadly Spanish flu pandemic.
<br><br>
The causes of World War I included the rise of Germany and decline of the Ottoman Empire, which disturbed the long-standing balance of power in Europe, and rising economic competition between nations driven by industrialisation and imperialism. Growing tensions between the great powers and in the Balkans reached a breaking point on 28 June 1914, when Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian Serb, assassinated the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne. Austria-Hungary blamed Serbia, and declared war on 28 July. After Russia mobilised in Serbia's defence, Germany declared war on Russia and France, who had an alliance. The United Kingdom entered after Germany invaded Belgium, and the Ottomans joined the Central Powers in November. Germany's strategy in 1914 was to quickly defeat France then transfer its forces to the east, but its advance was halted in September, and by the end of the year the Western Front consisted of a near-continuous line of trenches from the English Channel to Switzerland. The Eastern Front was more dynamic, but neither side gained a decisive advantage, despite costly offensives. Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece and others joined in from 1915 onward.
<br><br>
Major battles, including at Verdun, the Somme, and Passchendaele, failed to break the stalemate on the Western Front. In April 1917, the United States joined the Allies after Germany resumed unrestricted submarine warfare against Atlantic shipping. Later that year, the Bolsheviks seized power in Russia in the October Revolution; Soviet Russia signed an armistice with the Central Powers in December, followed by a separate peace in March 1918. That month, Germany launched a spring offensive in the west, which despite initial successes left the German Army exhausted and demoralised. The Allied Hundred Days Offensive beginning in August 1918 caused a collapse of the German front line. Following the Vardar Offensive, Bulgaria signed an armistice in late September. By early November, the Ottoman Empire and Austria-Hungary had each signed armistices with the Allies, leaving Germany isolated. Facing a revolution at home, Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated on 9 November, and the war ended with the Armistice of 11 November 1918.

<p>The United States became directly involved in World War I after declaring war on Germany on April 6, 1917. The declaration ended nearly three years of American neutrality in the war since the beginning, and the country's involvement in the conflict lasted for eighteen months before a ceasefire and armistice were declared on November 11, 1918.</p>

<p>The Spanish flu lasted from March 1918 to June 1920, spreading even to the Arctic and remote Pacific islands. It is estimated that anywhere from 20 to 100 million people were killed worldwide, or the approximate equivalent of one third of the population of Europe, more than double the number killed in World War I. This extraordinary toll resulted from the extremely high infection rate of up to 50%. </p>

<p>Saturday morning about 10 o‘clock fire was discovered in the cream testing room of the Bronstad store. As soon as discovery was made, Otis Bronstad grabbed their fire extinguisher and went squirting a compound on it that smelled like the infernal regions but it checked the fire. When Otis got through A.C. Grimland arrived with another and proceeded to do some extinguishing. By this time the boys had the hose ready to play on the fire if it undertook to pull off any more stunts. Clarence Brown got his hand slightly burned while removing the oil stove which was the cause of the fire. We have not learned the amount of damage but it will not amount to much.</p>

wholesale and retail grocers he felt safe in assuring Mr. Hoover that
the great state of Texas, effective April 15, goes on a wheatless basis
until June 1, and longer if necessary.</p>
<p>Administrator Peden regards the sacrifice of Texas of her flour for the cause of war the biggest thing that the biggest state of the Union has accomplished since the food administration was inaugurated, and the only exception to the complete

<p>The economic barometer in this town is rising. On last Saturday the Model Grocery Co [competitor to <mark>G. O. Bronstad</mark>  & Son] is reported to have had the best day in its history, and similar to this is the optimistic sentiment of all other business men in town.</p>

<h4>1924-01-18</h4>
<p><mark>G. O. Bronstad</mark>  the other day collected an account that was <u>thirty-three</u> years "past due", a part of which was still an open account, and a part of which had been closed by a note thirty-four years ago. The debt itself was perhaps nearly forty years old. This is another case where an honest debt never grows out of date, nor was barred by limitation. It is another case where honesty and character outlived poverty.</p>

<p>The payment was spontaneous, without an effort on Mr. Bronstad's part. The account was not covered by judgment or by a deed of trust. But this debt was covered by the safest security in the world, and which is at the base of all credit. It was covered by a moral obligation. The note was so old that it had the appearance of a piece of fancy work, on account of its many fringes, but it was given by a maker who put a price on his character and upon his word of honor. Notes of this kind are nearly always paid.</p>

<p>Quite a large number of relatives and friends from here attended the Bronstad–Olson—Brown joint wedding anniversaries at Clifton Tuesday of this week. The occasion afforded <mark>G. O. Bronstad</mark>  the most sacred opportunity to return to his brother Mr. C. O. Bronstad a gold dollar which the latter had sent to him across the waters while he was a mere boy. Needless to say neither did Mr. C. O. when he sent the token nor did Mr. G. O. when he received it realize that it should eventually become a golden wedding anniversary gift and represent a brotherly faithfulness of over half a century.</p>

<h3>Biography of couples in Golden wedding</h3>

<p>In a peaceful valley of Norway, known as Romedal, in Hedemarken, there was born a baby boy, August 20, 1853. He was the third child in the family and the second son. His parents were Ole and Christine Bronstad.</p>
<p>These people chose Christian as the name of their new charge.</p>
<p>Here in the nurture of a beautiful country and kind parents, Christian thrived. In due time the boy was initiated into school work; his first school being located in a farm house where he attended school two years. [?] the Prestehjeid, or county, built a school house to which the boy was sent. The boy's father was a carpenter by trade, but was later put in charge of a mill. In this work, Christian often worked with his father.</p>
<p>During his teens, Christian heard glowing tales of America, the land of opportunity, of prosperity and freedom and of the bright things awaiting a young man there. Thus this young man's mind was soon {?} on coming to America. So when Mr. Hendrick Dahl visited back in Norway after having been in America, young Christian fell in line with many others and with Mr. Dahl as escort bid his native land, his friends and all his relations a fond farewell and turned toward America to seek his fortune. The party on leaving Norway set Bosque county, Texas, as their destination. In the first part of Nov. 1872, Christain Bronstad the young emigrant, left Norway. In Bordeaux, France, the party was held up three days. in Liverpool the ship Louisiana of the State Line was boarded. Immediately seasickness, and no doubt, homesickness, started. About a month was spent on the Atlantic, and for three days all passengers were shut up on account of the storms. Our immigrant landed at New Orleans, whence he was carried by rail and ships to Galveston, Texas. One of these ships was a mixed ship carrying immigrants, cattle, and everything else. Finally on Dec. 19th, 1872 this immigrant at the age of 18, arrived in Waco, Texas. This was a severely cold day and the Brazos was frozen over solid.</p>
<p>On arriving at Waco, Christian was met by Peter Tingstad, one of his four acquaintances in Texas, who helped him find employment. Young Christian landed a job as a dish washer in the "Lady Gay Restaurant," located on the square. Here he worked five days, and had sleeping quarters on the second floor of the same building. Five days a resident of Waco, he fell ill with typhoid fever.</p>
<p>After a few days, Frank Jackson, better known as Frank Bean, a darky [Afro-American ]living among the Norwegians of Bosque, came to Waco, and Christian rode to Bosque with him in his wagon. While resting on the way the negro left the wagon ,and on his return carried a hat full of eggs. The sick immigrant boy was taken by the negro to the Omenson home on Neils Creek. Here under the care of Dr. Cowen and the Omensons and Tingstads, he was brought back to health. However Dr. Cowen had declared that "The little Norwegian boy can't live much longer." Through the spring of '73 the boy was too weak for work, but later in the year he was employed in the saw mill and flour mills at Valley Mills. While at Valley Mills, Christian -- that was his name while there -- passed through the difficulties and embarrassments of learning the English language. To help in this, he even subscribed for a cheap paper published in Atlanta, Georgia. From the darkies, who enjoyed the little Norwegian and often loafed about the mill, he learned much, for with other people he felt embarrassed over his broken English. After being at Valley Mills about two years, having been recommended by Mr. [illegible] he took up his duties at the mills at Norway Mills on Neils Creek. His salary was $35.00 per month--a stupendous salary at that time. Meantime his brother Gulbrand, had joined him; his parents and others of the family coming to America still later. And so in 1877 we find Christian a miller at Norway Mills, Texas</p>
<p>In 1853 in Cherokee county, Texas, there lived a young couple, Ole and Antoinette Olson. On the 20th of Nov. 1855 there was born to this couple a baby boy, and they named him Oscar Miller. hence Oscar Miller Olson is a native Texan. In 1860 this couple moved to Brownsboro, Texas, where Mr. Olson was employed in a woodwork and blacksmith shop, which shop he later bought. But failing health caused him to sell and move to Bosque county. In 1861 this family with their 6 year old son, Oscar, bought a farm in the Norse community and settled. When the war came on Mr. Olson became a soldier in the Confederate army and was stationed at Tyler, Texas in a government shop. The family moved to Tyler and the young Oscar often helped his father with his work on second floor of the government shop, where Mr. Olson was in charge. After the war the family moved to their Bosque county farm.</p>
<p>Oscar Miller Olson was first in school at the old Peck school located in north of the so-called "sokkerton" or sugar loaf west of Norse. This school building was of a log cabin structure, had a dirt floor, one door, one shutter a fireplace and the benches were of split log. Oscar's first teacher was a Mr. Ole Olson, commonly called Red Ole --his hair suggesting the name. In school Oscar, a full fledged Texas of that time was a real boy, full of life and vigor. He was liked pretty well by the teacher, though, and was granted special privileges, such as studying out-doors in the shade of trees, etc. On account of this the other boys poked fun at him, But the doctor still feels that no one got the best of him</p>
<p>Young Oscar often helped his dad make matches, scarce articles in those times. On one occasion after dipping a thousand or more matches, much labor was lost. The matches were left in the open over night to dry. in the morning they were forgotten and the warm sun soon ignited the phosphorus tipped sticks and all went up in smoke. As time went on this young man's interest turned to medicine. Consequently in 1872 we find Oscar M. Olson beginning the study of medicine under Dr. J. G. Parshal, on second floor of the old rock school building on the east bank of the Bosque River at Clifton. Here he studied part-time under Dr. Tergerson. This year's work under a doctor gave him a year's credit in medical college. Next he attended the Galveston Medical College, then a private institution. He graduated from this school in 1873. After graduation he was in the drug business and practiced medicine at Norway Mills and there we fine him in 1877.</p>
<p>In 1854 Ovee Colwick and his wife, Johanna, came to America, and in 1855, with their son, Theodore, they were living in LaSalle county, Ill. Here Dec. 8, 1855, a daughter was Born, and she was named Margaret Cecilia Hjelm. On May 20th 1857, another girl came into this family, and she was named Martha Christine. By early spring 1859, induced by reports of cheap and good land in Texas, and possibly by a desire to move to a less thickly settled country, and led on by that pioneer and colonizer Kleng Peerson, Mr. and Mrs. Ovee Colwick, with their four children, Theodore, Margaret, Martha, and John, started for Texas. With them on this trip was Mrs. B. C. Martin, a sister of Mrs. Colwick. Four weeks were spent sailing down the Mississippi River to New Orleans. From there another ship carried them on to Galveston, whence they reshipped to Houston. From Houston they traveled by ox cart to Neills Creek valley in Bosque county. Kleng Peerson, growing old and weary, gave to Ovee Colwick half of the estate given him as colonizer by the state. In return for this he was to have a home and be cared for the rest of his life, and until his death he lived with the Colwicks.</p>
<p>These two girls, Margaret and Martha, started their school careers in the old Peck school near the Sugar Loaf mountain -- the same school in which Oscar Olson also attended. . . .</p>

<blockquote class ="wiki">From Wikipedia<br>( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AM_broadcasting )<br>

<h4>Vacuum tube transmitters</h4>

Advances in vacuum tube technology (called "valves" in British usage), especially after around 1915, revolutionized radio technology. Vacuum tube devices could be used to amplify electrical currents, which overcame the overheating issues of needing to insert microphones directly in the transmission antenna circuit. Vacuum tube transmitters also provided high-quality AM signals, and could operate on higher transmitting frequencies than alternator and arc transmitters.[20] Non-governmental radio transmissions were prohibited in many countries during World War I, but AM radiotelephony technology advanced greatly due to wartime research, and after the war the availability of tubes sparked a great increase in the number of amateur radio stations experimenting with AM transmission of news or music. Vacuum tubes remained the central technology of radio for 40 years, until transistors began to dominate in the late 1950s, and are still used in the highest power broadcast transmitters.
<h4>Receivers</h4>
Unlike telegraph and telephone systems, which used completely different types of equipment, most radio receivers were equally suitable for both radiotelegraph and radiotelephone reception. In 1903 and 1904 the electrolytic detector and thermionic diode (Fleming valve) were invented by Reginald Fessenden and John Ambrose Fleming, respectively. Most important, in 1904–1906 the crystal detector, the simplest and cheapest AM detector, was developed by G. W. Pickard. Homemade crystal radios spread rapidly during the next 15 years, providing ready audiences for the first radio broadcasts. One limitation of crystals sets was the lack of amplifying the signals, so listeners had to use earphones, and it required the development of vacuum-tube receivers before loudspeakers could be used. The dynamic cone loudspeaker, invented in 1924, greatly improved audio frequency response over the previous horn speakers, allowing music to be reproduced with good fidelity.[21] AM radio offered the highest sound quality available in a home audio device prior to the introduction of the high-fidelity, long-playing record in the late 1940s.

<h3>Obit Ole Bronstad  </h3>
<p>In the passing away of Mr. Ole Bronstad the career of one of the most honored and respected members of the Norse community has come to its close. During the last few days it was evident that the time was close at hand and this occurred at 11:47 p. m., July 6, at his home west of Clifton.</p>
<p>Born in Arendal, Norway, February 25, 1848. When a boy of only four years he came with his parents in 1852 to Henderson, County Texas. Only a few months later the father [<mark>Johan Olsen Bronstad, b. 27 February 1816, Harstad, Romedal, Hedemarken, Norway</mark>  ] died [buried [Four Mile Cemetery, VanZandt County, TX] of that dreaded disease [Malaria, one supposes] which claimed so many victims from the people of that region in those early years.</p>
<p>In 1854 the little family moved to Bosque county where shortly afterwards the young widow become the Bride of Mr Berger T. Rogstad.</p>
<p>From his early boyhood Mr. Bronstad was thus acquainted with all the thrills and hardships as well as the inspiration that is a part of the daily life of the pioneer. He was one of the few men now remaining who in 1867 joined in company to drive the Comanche Indians out of Bosque county. About the same time in 1866-67 he hauled cedar logs with yokes of oxen from the Brazos river for building the old water mill north of Clifton.</p>
<p>During his long career Mr. Bronstad was a constant resident of Bosque County, taking an active part in the building up of the community to its present status.</p>
<p>He was taken ill in August five years ago and during the last three and a half years had been confined to his bed on account of the wound from his amputated left leg below the knee that could not be made to heal. At times he suffered severe pain, but his patience and Christian fortitude was remarkable. Mr. Bronstad was a life-long member of the Lutheran Church and rejoiced in the comfort and the hope that the Word of God does bring. In this respect, as in many others He has left to his family and friends an example worthy of praise.</p>
<p>In 1873 Mr. Bronstad was married to Miss Matilda Canuteson who died in 1920. Eleven children were born to this union, of whom nine are still living. These are: Mrs. Anton Nelson, Mrs. B. F. Hutcherson, Clifton; Mrs. A. G. Nelson, Mrs. O.D. Cowen, both of Houston; Mrs. O. S. Bakke, West of Clifton; Mr. Ollie M. Bronstad, Clifton; Jessie A., Eddie G. and Julian C. all west of Clifton. Three brothers and one sister are still living: John, Thomas, Bernt and Pauline Rogstad all of Bosque County, except the sister who lives in New Mexico.</p>
<p>Funeral services were conducted Tuesday afternoon at the home and at the Norse Lutheran Church with interment at the Norse cemetery. Rev. P. E. Thorson assisted by Rev. O. T. Boe, officiated.</p>
<p>The four sons of the deceased and Messrs. A. O. Nelson and O. S. Bakke acted as pallbearers. Honorary pallbearers were: A. B. Amundson, C. M. Bakke, Chas. Canuteson, Christian Dahl, Ed. Godager, John Godager, J. M. Jenson, O. C. Johnson, J. M. Nelson, M. J. Olson, John Pederson, J. E. Petterson, John Rogstad, Thomas Rogstad, Ole C. Pederson, C. Canuteson, Neil Sinrude, J. G. Jorgenson. - A Friend</p>

<blockquote class="Cy2"><img class="mlr" src="../pic/Pinky/Walt-pinky.png" alt="picture Walt Bronstad">&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another line of Bronstad's in Bosque county, seemingly not related to my line, for they hailed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arendal" target="_blank">Arendal, Norway</a>, on the Southern tip of Norway.

Yet, Ole's Father, Johan Olsen Bronstad, as revealed by <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/details/LDZ2-YF4" target="_blank"> Family Search</a> came from Romedal, Norway.

<br><br>  Ole Bronstad  of Arendal (born 1848-02-25), {not to be confusedd with Ole Anderson Bronstad of Hedmarken (born 1816-01-11), Father of Gulbrand Bronstad}, was more a contremprary of Ole Foss, (born either 1843-08-10 in Toten Norway or 1844-04-27 in Oslo, Norway) Uncle of Laura Wilhelmina Bronstad. I find no indication that Ole Bronstad of Arendal fought in the Civil War like Ole Foss, but the readiness of Ole Bronstad to battle Comanches in Bosque County, circa 1867, suggests he did. And if he was in the war, he was continuously on the Confederate side, and safe to remain in Texas.

<h3>CHRISTIAN O. BRONSTAD</h3>
<p> Mr. Christian O. Bronstad was born at Romedal, Hedemarken, Norway, August 20th, 1853. His parents were Ole and Christine Bronstad. He attended the school of his native parish and having received the necessary instruction in the Word of God he was confirmed in this baptismal covenant.</p>
<p>During his teens, Christian heard glowing tales of America, the land of opportunity, of prosperity and freedom and of the bright things awaiting a young man there. Thus this young man’s mind was soon settled oncoming to America. So when Mr. Hendrick Dahl visited back in Norway after having been in America, young Christian fell in line with many others, with Mr. Dahl as escort bid his native land, his friends and all his relatives a fond farewell and turned toward America to seek his fortune. The party on leaving Norway set Bosque County, Texas, as their destination. In the first part of November, 1872, Christian Bronstad, the young emigrant, left Norway. In Bordeaux, France the party was held up three days. In Liverpool another delay, this time of eleven days, held them up. From Liverpool the ship Louisiana of the State Line was boarded. About a month was spent on the Atlantic, and for three days all passengers were shut up on account of the storms. Finally in December 19, 1872 this immigrant at the age of 18, arrived in Waco, Texas.: So reads part of the biography read at the Golden Wedding of Mr. And Mrs. Christian O. Bronstad on March 1, 1927.</p>
<p>Mr. Bronstad was employed about two years in the saw mills and flour mills in Valley Mills. Then he took up his duties at the mill at Norway Mills on Neill’s Creek. Meantime his brother, Gulbrand, had joined him; his parents and others of the family coming to America still later.</p>
<p>On march 1, 1877, Mr. Bronstad was united in marriage to Martha Colwick. It was a double wedding the other couple being Dr. O. M. Olson and Margaret Colwick. The Rev. Ole Estren performed the ceremony.</p>
<p>For about two and a half years after this double wedding the ;young miller and his bride lived at Norway Mills. Leaving the ;mill they lived for a short while on the Colwick farm. In January, 1881, they moved to a newly acquired farm in the Harmony community. Mr. Bronstad was a faithful ;member of Our savior’s Lutheran Church of Norse for nearly fifty years. He was a community worker; worked for better schools, better roads, and has been active in promoting and supporting Clifton College.</p>
<p>Then years ago Mr. And Mrs. Bronstad moved to Clifton where they have resided since. On March 1, 1927 occurred the Golden Wedding of Mr. And Mrs. Christian O. Bronstad and Dr. and Mrs O. M. Olson and the Silver Wedding of Mr. And Mrs. C. A. Brown. Multitudes of friends and neighbors from Clifton and the entire community came to rejoice and bring their friendly greetings to the honored couples in the Bronstad home where the Golden Wedding was held.</p>
<p>A family of twelve__five girls and seven boys, and one grandson have been reared buy Mr. and Mrs. C. O. Bronstad. We can well understand what a source of joy it must have been to Mr. And Mrs. C. O. Bronstad on that memorable occasion of their Golden Wedding to have all their children with them and receive their testimony of love and esteem.</p>
<p>Mr. Bronstad was a faithful member of the Trinity Lutheran Church since his moving to Clifton. He was seen in his usual place at church both at the morning and night services the last Sunday he lived.</p>
<p>That necessary institution in every Christian home: the family altar or family devotion, was kept up by him. Much comfort, guidance and strength was no doubt received in this way during his life. â€œLet the World of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom.: Family devotion anchors the soul, so that it will not very readily drift from God. It draws down upon the domestic circle the blessing of God. We have the assurance that where two or three are gathered in Christ’s name, He will be with them.</p>
<p>Mr. Bronstad understood for some time that the remaining years allotted to him were most likely to be few. But the thought of departing from this life did not annoy or perplex him. He had peace with god. â€œJustified by faith, we have peace with God through our lord Jesus Christ. that was his comfort.</p>
<p>Death came at 10:30, Saturday night, January 20th. Thus, one of God’s noblemen had finished his course,</p>
<p>His passing is a loss to the community. In his friendly and Christian way he wielded a great influence for good. Men who stand like he did on the side of the right and good, who support those institutions which make for true happiness, they are the leaven on society.</p>
<p>Men who can be trusted and relied upon, and who walk among us as examples of civic and Christian virtues, they exalt righteousness, and are an honor to their community.</p>
<p>For him who has passed from our midst, to die was gain,that is our Christian hope.</p>
<p>Funeral services were conducted at the home and at the Trinity Lutheran Church on Monday afternoon at 1:30 with interment in the Trinity Lutheran cemetery, Clifton, Rev. O. T. Boe assisted by Rev. P. E. Thorson and Prof. C. Tyssen, who spoke on behalf of Clifton College, officiated. . . .</p>
<p>He leaves to mourn his departure his wife and the following children: Mrs. C. A. Brown, Miss Millie Bronstad, C.G. Bronstad, J. M. Bronstad, A. L. Bronstad and Mrs. J. M. Huse, all of Clifton; O. K. Bronstad of Fort Worth; M. T. Bronstad of Denison; C. S. Bronstad of Caddo; Mrs. Frank E. Smith of Waco; O. A. Bronstad of Coolidge; and the grandson, Leroy e. Bronstad of Ft. Worth. A daughter, Miss May Bronstad, preceded him in death on August 23, 1930. He also leaves the following sisters and brothers: Mes. Andrea Nelson, Miss Syverine Bronstad, Miss Carrie Bronstad, and Otto Bronstad, all of Waco; <mark>G. O. Bronstad</mark>  of Cranfills gap; Mrs. Pernilla Anderson of near Clifton. Also 17 grandchildren and 5 great grandchildren. He also leaves a large number of other kin and a large circle of friends.</p>

<h3> <mark>G. O. Bronstad</mark>  Bosque Pioneer, Passes Away.</h3>
<p><mark>G. O. Bronstad</mark> , pioneer Bosque County citizen, died at his home at Cranfills Gap, Sunday, July 19, 1937, at about 1:45 p. m. Funeral services were conducted Monday afternoon at the St. Olaf Lutheran Church with interment in the St. Olaf Cemetery.</p>
<p>Mr. Bronstad was born March 9, 1856, in Romedal, Hedemarken, Norway. In 1874, at the age of 18, he emigrated to the United States, coming direct to Bosque County, Texas, where he joined his brother, C. O., at Valley Mills. Here in Bosque County he at once made his home and in due time adopted this country as his own. During his long life he has been an active and contributing citizen.</p>
<p>From 1874 to 1886 he lived successively at Valley Mills, Norway Mills and Morgan, engaging in business and learning merchandising. In 1886 he moved to Cranfills Gap, and opened his business concern in Cranfills Gap. Thus Mr. Bronstad successfully rounded out more than fifty years in business in this one location</p>
<p>In the land of his nativity he was baptized, and after proper training, was confirmed in the Lutheran Church. To this faith, confessed early in life, he remained true to the end.</p>
<p>This now departed highly respected citizen, lived a quiet, unassuming life, sincere in spirit, sympathetic, generous, and cheerful. In spite of severe experiences in business, he remained of sympathetic and kindly nature, giving service to his friends from far and near. All men were greeted with a smile in the Bronstad Store.</p>
<p>Due to the absence of his pastor, Rev. W. J. Maakestad, Rev. P. E. Thorson of Norse conducted the funeral services, assisted by Rev. O. T. Boe of Clifton and Rev. Farmer, Cranfills Gap. Inspiring music was furnished by St. Olaf Male Quartet, and by Mrs. Troll and Miss Knudson in a vocal duet.</p>
<p>Beside his wife, he leaves six children, Otis, Clyde, and Homer, Margaret, Mrs. C. L. Rohne and Mrs. Douglas Hudson. These all reside at Cranfills Gap except Mrs. Hudson, who lives in Holdenville, Okla. He is also survived by one brother, Otto, of Waco, and three sisters, Carrie and Syverine Bronstad of Waco, and Mrs Pernella Anderson, Clifton.</p>
<p>The large gathering of sorrowing friends and relatives that overflowed the spacious church was something of an indication of the high esteem in which Mr. Bronstad was held. Representatives from every section of Bosque County, from Hamilton and Coryell Counties, came to pay tribute to a good friend, a christian gentleman, an high-class merchant, a man. </p>

<h2>Olson Bronstad Family</h2>		


		<p><mark>Gulbrand Olson Bronstad</mark>  was born March 9, 1856 in Romadal Hedemarken, Norway. In 1874, he emigrated to United States and came direct to Valley Mills where he spent some time with his brother Christian.</p>
		<p>From 1874 to 1886 he lived at Valley Mills, Norway Mills, Waco and Morgan during which time he learned to speak English and had a variety of business experiences.</p>
		<p>At Morgan he met Morris Wiel, bookkeeper for Miller merchandising Store. In 1887 Miller went bankrupt and Bronstad and Wiel formed a partnership, bought the bankrupt stock and moved it to Cranfills Gap where they set up a general merchandising store. After a short time in the business, Wiel decided to go back to Germany, leaving Bronstad as the sole owner of the store.</p>
		<p>On November 30, 1893 he was married, to Laura Hansen, daughter of Jurgen and Petra Foss Hansen, who lived near the Rock Church, the corner stone of which was laid in 1886. The wedding was the "talk of the town", as Bronstad had been an eligible bachelor, it would be very interesting to know how many buggies, hacks and surreys were at the hitching post on that day.</p>
		<p>To this union were born six children. Otis married Selma Tergerson. He was his dad's partner. Later, he was Postmaster in Cranfills Gap. Clyde married Louise Walton. He worked in Bronstad's Store for several years and later worked in Waco and Fort Worth. Marie married Chris Rohne. She also worked in the store until she married. Lorine married Douglas Hudson in Oklahoma. She was a nurse. Later she assisted him in their funeral business. Homer married Travis Knudson. He was a teacher, principal, superintendent and later a consultant for the Texas Education Agency. Marguerite lived at home with her parents. She helped her mother cook and do the household chores. There was often a guest or two besides the family at meals.</p>
		<p>Bronstad made many trips to markets in Waco, Dallas and St. Louis. He went by buggy to Clifton or McGregor where he left his horse and buggy at a livery stable and boarded the train for his destination. When in Waco, he stayed with his three sisters, Andrea Nelson, Carrie and Syverine. When his purchases were delivered to Clifton by train, they were hauled to the store by wagons drawn by mules.</p>
		<p>From the time that he was the sole owner, Bronstad was very active in community affairs. He worked with others in setting up a school. He operated his business finances much like a bank, extended credit, made loans to his customers and others, accepted deposits of cash, accepted drafts from other banks, etc.</p>
		<p>In 1910, with the help of J. W. Butler, he secured a loan of $10,000 from an individual in Colorado to use as the capital stock for the charter of First Guaranty State * Bank at Cranfills Gap. Bronstad was on the Board of Directors who elected him first president.
He was associated with W. T. Tergerson, Pitt Barnes and H. E. Tippet in organizing the Cranfills Gap Development Company in 1913. This organization brought about the move of the business section to its present location.</p>
		<p>In 1904, G. O. and Laura Bronstad enjoyed several days at the World's Fair in St. Louis. The Fair was in celebration of the centennial of the Louisiana Purchase.</p>
		<p>He made two trips back to Norway. Otto Reesing accompanied him on the second trip in 1914. They narrowly missed being stranded in Europe when World War I began.</p>
		<p><mark>G. O. Bronstad</mark>  died in the family home in Cranfills Gap on July 18, 1937. Chris Rohne wrote in The History of Cranfills Gap, "For fifty years until his death Bronstad's Store was the heart and soul of Cranfills Gap. He befriended many with credit, when the giving was a real sacrifice to his business and his family, but many forgot to pay him. But through it all he lived a life radiating friendship and goodwill'.
From the time that he was the sole owner, Bronstad was very active in community affairs. He worked with others in setting up a school.

<H3>Grandpa Ole Anderson Ajar Bronstad</H3>
   was born January 11, 1816, at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furnes,_Norway" target="_blank">Ajar, Furnaes, Norway</a>; and Grandma Christine Christensdatter Bronstad was born May 3, 1820 at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romedal_(village)" target="_blank">Romedal, Norway</a>. Grandpa Bronstad was a carpenter by trade. Grandpa and Grandma Bronstad had eight children as follows: Pernella (Mrs. Syver Anderson), Andreas, Christian 0., Gulbrand 0., Andrea (Mrs- Lauris Nelson), Syverine, Karen, and Otto- These all came to America except Andreas- He remained in Norway, was married, and raised a daughter. However all these three are deceased; so their line is ended.
<P> Grandpa and Grandma Bronstad came to Texas in September 1878. They made their home with the C. O. Bronstad family for many years. It is said that Grandpa Bronstad liked to go hunting, and that he had a muzzle loading shotgun. And with this he would saunter out over the pasture and bring home rabbits. Grandma Bronstad is well remembered by her grandchildren whom she loved- She was a kind and considerate Grandma who treated us with great love and concern, and whom we all loved so very much. She was a great help in the rearing of the C. 0. Bronstad family where she had her home many years. 
Grandpa Bronstad died August 31, 1891, and Grandma Bronstad died November 5, 1906. They both lie buried in Our Savior's Lutheran Church Cemetery, Norse. Texas. Their grave markers bear this inscription in Norwegian: "FRED MED DIT STOEVE - VELSIGNET VAERE DIT MINDE". Translated this is: "PEACE TO YOUR DUST-BLESSED BE YOUR MEMORY".</p><P> 
Grandpa Ovee Kjolvig was born at Jelse Sogn, the Kjolvig homestead, near Stavanger, Norway, March 27, 1825. It is said that he spent only a few months in school, he was reared and instructed from early childhood in the Lutheran Church.
His father, Torger Kjolvig, was a fisherman by trade, and their home was near the sea. It was natural then that the boy, Ovee, together with his two older brothers, Sten and Torsten, spent much of their leisure time at the seashore, watching the fishermen's boats sail out to sea, and see others returning laden with fish. The appeal of the sea was so strong, and so enticing to the brothers Kjolvig, that all three became fishermen. </p><P> 
Ovee early had a boat of his own, and was engaged in fishing, selling and shipping fish. While on one of his fishing trips off the rugged coast of Norway, his boat capsized and sank during a storm, and he narrowly escaped drowning. He was rescued in an unconscious condition, but was revived and his life saved.
On July 7, 1853, Grandpa Kjolvig was married to Johanna Margareta Naadland, also of Jelse Sogn, near Stavanger, Norway. Grandma Johanna Kjolvig was born March 17, 1831. Her home too was near the sea. In fact, her family traveled by boat when they went to church services on Sundays. One of her brothers had the distinction of being a member of the Storting (Norway's Congress).</p><P>  
She too was interested in America, and joined her husband in braving the hazards of an ocean voyage, and joining with other pioneer women with their husbands on their way to help build and enjoy this land of the free, and the home of the brave. Her sister, Bergitte Cecelia Naadland accompanied the Kjolvigs to America; she was more familiarly known as Mrs. B. C. Martin, or Aunt C. You see, Grandpa Kjolvig wanted to go to the "land of opportunity".</p><P> 
In the summer of 1854, the Kjolvigs bid farewell to their native Norway to cast their lot in a new land and there to seek their fortune and satisfaction. Their voyage across the sea was a rather eventful one. While at sea, their first child was born. He was baptized on the day of his birth and named Thomas Theodore, July 2, 1854.</p><P>  
After 15 weeks sailing, their ship reached Quebec, Canada, and Grandpa Kjolvig was a sick man with a case of cholera, so he was hospitalized. As soon as he was able to travel, the party of four set out for LaSalle County, Illinois. On their arrival there they settled almost penniless for a period of five years. And while there in Illinois, they Americanized their name, changing Kjolvig to Colwick, the name kept by the family since that time.</p><P> 
While in Illinois, the Colwicks heard glowing tales of the state of Texas, the productive lands, the grassy prairies, the wonderful climate, etc., and they turned their thoughts to Texas. They learned to know the trailblazer and colonizer, Cleng Peerson, and, being swayed by Peerson's wonderful accounts of Texas, they decided to travel to this new state as soon as possible, and there to make their permanent home.</p><P> 
Under the leadership of Cleng Peerson, a company was formed including the Colwick family then numbering four children: Thomas Theodore, Margaret, Martha and John N. Also included in the party were Miss Naadland (Aunt C) and the 0. A. Canuteson family.</p><P>  
Four long weeks were spent sailing down the Mississippi River to New Orleans. From there, another ship took them to Galveston. There they reshipped to Houston- From Houston, they traveled by ox wagon to the Neils Creek valley in Bosque County, Texas. Cleng Peerson, then growing old and not able to work as a colonizer any longer, gave half the land which the state of Texas had given him as a colonizer to Grandpa Ovee Colwick. In return for this, Mr. Peerson had a home with and was cared for by the Colwicks until his death in 1865, at the age of 82 years. He lies buried in the Norse cemetery. His grave is graced by a tall marker placed there by his friends.</p><P> 
Here in Bosque County the Colwicks built their home, settied, and spent the rest of their lives in the Neils Creek valley. When the Civil War broke out, Grandpa Colwick answered the call for service, and Grandma Colwick assumed the responsibility of holding and keeping the family and farm in order. Indians were a constant threat. At one time, three Indians came, dismounted, and walked into the home unannounced, and showed by signs that they were hungry and wanted food. Grandma calmly and hastily prepared food for them, and they ate heartily, carrying on an animated conversation in their own language. Their hunger satisfied, they rose from their chairs, bowed politely, left the house, and rode away.</p>
<P>Four sons and four daughters were born to Ovee and Johanna Colwick: Thomas Theodore, Margaret (Mrs. Dr. 0. M. Olson), Martha (Mrs. C. 0. Bronstad), John N., Sam Houston, Olivia (Mrs. T. A. Eggen), Alfred M., and Jennie Belle (Mrs. S. H. Reesing). Grandma Johanna Colwick died March 25, 1881.
On Nov. 3, 1881, Grandpa Ovee Colwick was married to Miss Mathea Erickson who had then very recently come here from Norway. To this marriage seven children were born, six growing to maturity, and they were Emil T., Millie (Mrs. Dude Cox), Clara (Mrs. A. B. Amundson), Magnus L., Agnes, and Lillie (Mrs. August Heck).
Grandpa Ovee Colwick died July 12, 1895 at the age of 70 years.
Our mother, Martha Christine, was the third child of Grandpa and Grandma Colwick. She was born May 20, 1857 in LaSalle County, Illinois. She came to Texas with her family in 1859</p>
<P>Mother attended the Peck school located on Gary creek near the "sugar loaf" mountain-Her first teacher was a Mr. Orbeck. Martha, the little girl, was very timid and scared, and the teacher's rather harsh voice did not help matters at all. However, Mr. Orbeck proved to be very kind. A Mr. Dickerman was
another teacher in this school. He kept his pistol hanging on the wall. </p>
<P>Those were the times when Indians were frequently seen, when the deer lay quietly along the path where the children walked to school, when horse thieves were manhandled, and when Bosque County was a wide open country. </p>
<P>The teacher, Mr. Dickerman, used his own system of awards to pupils excelling in some school project, For instance, when some pupil distinguished him or herself in spelling, the award was a "ticket", one by two inches, decorated with drawings of roses, etc. When a pupil had won ten of these he was given a larger "ticket", about five by seven inches, decorated by drawings of birds, hearts, roses, and complimentary inscriptions. And Mr. Dickerman signed himself as the "Preceptor of Norman Academy". Norman Hill was the name of the Post Office about two miles distant.</p>
<P>Martha and her girl friends, in their free time, enjoyed watching the boys in their rougher games. Then they played "jacks", using rocks in place of the commercialized articles used in the modern game of "jacks". Gary creek, a few yards away, offered alurements. The banks of the creek with its loose sand made excellent play space for the younger girls.
<P>There on the Colwick farm in the Neils Creek valley, our mother grew to womanhood, spinning, riding horseback, doing farm chores, and helping her parents as needs arose.</p>
<P>Grandpa Colwick was a successful farmer-stockman. However, late in his life he met with a serious accident while going about his farm work. He was attacked by a mean bull. The bull gored him in the fierce tussle. He survived the incident, but from then on he walked with crutches.</p>
<P>Our father, <H3><a name="0.C">Christian 0. Bronstad</a></H3>, the third child and second son of Grandpa and Grandma Ole Bronstad, was born August 20, 1853 in Romedal, Hedemarken, Norway. He thrived under the nurture of a beautiful country and kind parents. In due time the young boy was initiated into school work. His first school was located in a farm home. There he attended school two years. Then the "prestegjeld" or county built a school-house to which the boy was sent 
During his early teens, Christian heard glowing tales of America, the land of opportunity, of prosperity, of freedom, and of bright things awaiting a young man there. Thus this young man's mind was soon fully settled on going to America. 
<P>So when Mr. Hendrick Dahl visited back in Norway after having been in America, young Christian fell in line with a number of others, and, with Mr. Dahl as escort, bid his native land, his friends and relatives a fond farewell, and turned to America to seek his fortune. The party, on leaving Norway, set Bosque County, Texas, as their destination. In the first part of November, 1872, Christian 0. Bronstad, age 19, the young emigrant, left Norway, never to return. In Bordough [sic], France, the party was held up a few days. In Liverpool a delay of 11 days occurred.</p> 
<P>At Liverpool the party boarded the ship Louisiana of the State Line. Immediately seasickness, and no doubt homesickness too, set in. About a month was spent on the Atlantic, and for three days all passengers were shut in on account of the storms. Dad, our immigrant, landed at New Orleans, whence was carried by rail and ship to Galveston, Texas. This was a mixed ship carrying people, cattle, and everything else. Finally on Dec. 19, 1872, this immigrant arrived in Waco, Texas. </p>
<P>This was a severely cold day and the Brazos river was frozen over solid.
On arriving in Waco, young Christian was met by Peter Tingstad, one of his four acquaintances in Texas, and he helped him find employment.</p> 
<P> Young Christian landed a job as dishwasher in the "Lady Gay Restaurant", located on the square. Here he worked five days and had sleeping quarters on the second floor of the same building. Five days a resident of Waco, he fell ill with typhoid fever. </p> 
<P>After a few days, Frank Jackson, better known as Frank Bean, a Negro from Bosque County came to Waco, heard of the sick Norwegian boy, and brought him to his wagon to Bosque County. While resting on the way, Frank left the wagon for a
while and on his return carried a hat full of eggs. The sick immigrant boy was taken to the Omenson home in the Neils Creek valley. Here under the good care of Dr. Cowen, the Omensons, and the Tingstads, he was brought back to good health. However, Dr. Cowen had at one time declared that the "Little Norwegian" could not get well. Through the spring of 1873 he was too weak to work, but later he was employed in the flour mill at Valley Mills.</p> 
<P>While at Valley Mills the young miller passed through the difficulties of learning the language of the land, and the embarrassments involved. To help him in this, he subscribed to a cheap paper published in Atlanta, Ga.
After being at Valley Mills about two years, having been recommended by a Mr. Igelhart, he became the miller at Norway Mills in the Neils Creek valley. His salary was $35.00 per month, a stupendous salary at that time. </p> 
<P>Meantime his brother Gulbrand had joined him here in Bosque County. His parents and others of the family, came here in 1878.</p> 
<P>At Norway Mills he worked as miller for Mr. A. Y. Reeder who was one of the leading business men of the area. Norway Mills became quite a community center and inland town. </p> 
<P>It flourished from about 1870 to 1890. The milling business seemed to be about the biggest business to draw attention there, however, there were other businesses established in the area. Mr. Reeder, besides building the rock mill house and the two storied rock residence which still stands fully furnished, built the first cotton gin. This was a horse-powered outfit. Later, after the mill was built, the gin power was furnished from the mill by cables. Mr. Reeder also had a merchandising store, and he was Postmaster. The Post Office was established April 12, 1879. Others who held the office of Postmaster there were J. A. Lyon, John S. Odle, George J. Stapleton, Richard M. Mayfield. Mr. Mayfield continued in office until July 11, 1890 when it was discontinued.</p> 
<P>While Daddy was the miller there, Norway Mills grew to be quite a thriving business center. A Drug Store was operated by Dr. Barlow. Later Dr. 0. M. 01son had the Drug Store. And Dr. Cowan had one at one time. There were two blacksmith shops. Mr. Reeder had one and a Mr. Reed had the other one. There were other merchandising houses in operation.</p> 
<P>Then there were the photographers who seemed to drift in. They set up tents for their "photograph galleries". A Mr. Knight, a single man, had such a "gallery". Hodges and Lindgren, both swedes, set up their tent "galleries". This Mr. Hodges died from TB and was buried in the Norway Mills cemetery.</p> 
<P>It had been related that there was quite a stir the night the Reed home burned. This was on a night of preaching at the schoolhouse yes, surely there was a school at Norway Mills, there was a "traveling preacher" in charge. Mrs. Reed was in the schoolhouse meeting and became frantic, fearing that her husband was being burned to death he sometimes indulged too freely in liquor. To make things worse, Mr. Reed kept a pair of guns and a great deal of ammunition. These shells were popping off in lively fashion, and none dared to go even close to the burning building. All kept their distance. Billy Hill's house also burned. This occurred at about the time the Bronstads moved away, so Mr. Hill bought the Bronstad house.</p> 
<P>Dr. Barlow, who operated a Drug Store for some time at Norway Mills, was reportedly a rather eccentric man. However, as Drug Store operator he seemed to know his business. People reported their ills to him and he would prescribe the cures. He gave remedies for all ills whether he was an M. D. or not. He was sometimes charged with illicit sales of liquors. One thing he would not allow was to have loiterers or customers sitting on the counters. So when his wishes were not compiled with, he drove spikes up through the counters to keep them off. A cowboy came in and sat on one of the spikes, started a vi1e tirade against Mr. Barlow, and reached for his gun. At that time Mr. Barlow left for the other room.</p> 
<P>According to our Dad, who operated the mill for several years, the mill was operated by steam power. The necessary water was drawn from the branch near by, and they got plenty of wood from the hills. It was a burr system mill, two large stones, the lower one stationary, and the upper one revolving by the steam power. These stones were very heavy, about five feet in diameter, and handled by means of cranes. A hopper over the center of the top stone fed the mill. As the top stone revolved the grain was crushed and ground, and worked out around the edges. This was then caught up by elevators which carried it to the sifters. The sifters were of fine silk. By this sifting, two grades of flour were made, besides the rich bran. They also ground graham flour and corn meal. There were three sets of grindstones in this mill.
Norway Mill flour was considered to be very good. It was fine and white and made fine bread. The secret of the milling process by this system, our Dad, said, was to know just how fine to grind the flour how tight to work the millstones. It had to be ground fine enough to get the flour out, but not too fine or black specks would appear in parts of the ground up bran. Another thing that made for success of milling by the burr system was the notching or roughing of the stones. By much grinding, the stones would work slick. Then the miller, while the other stones were in action, would notch or roughen the face of the other stone. The successful miller knew just how to do this.</P>
<P>
Norway Mills marketed much flour in various parts of Texas. Waco was a regular shipping point. Much went to west Texas to Hamilton, Brownwood, and even to Stephens County. Wagons from various points came there for flour and other products. The mill also sent out its own freighters with loads of products. A Mr. Davis was such a freighter for the mill. People from near by, as well as from distant points brought their grain for grinding, would wait, and return home with their products as per orders. The mill in such cases took a one-sixth part toll for grinding.</P>
<P>There were difficulties to be met and handled in those days too. Sometimes ladies would bring grain to be processed, and would expect or want to be served first. But the rule of the mill was "first come, first served". Some of the ladies thought this was ungentlemanly conduct. Then too people would bring grain of all quantites and qualities. Often they worked far into the night to finish the day's work for their waiting customers. The quality of some of the grain was bad. Some would bring it in dirty, musty, and of very inferior quality. Yet, all would expect excellent flour from their grain.</P>
<P>Water for domestic use at "the Mill" was drawn from a common community well. The means of getting the water? A chain, a pulley, and a bucket.</P>
<P>By about 1890 the dwindling of the water supply made the continuance of the flour mill at Norway Mills inadvisable. And with the closing of the mill, Norway Mills gradually closed out as a community center. Taking its place as community centers were Hurst Springs and Norse, and these places thrived for twenty or thirty years.</P>
