<h2>Olson Bronstad Family</h2>		


		<p>Gulbrand Olson Bronstad was born March 9, 1856 in Romadal Hedemarken, Norway. In 1874, he emigrated to United States and came direct to Valley Mills where he spent some time with his brother Christian.</p>
		<p>From 1874 to 1886 he lived at Valley Mills, Norway Mills, Waco and Morgan during which time he learned to speak English and had a variety of business experiences.</p>
		<p>At Morgan he met Morris Wiel, bookkeeper for Miller merchandising Store. In 1887 Miller went bankrupt and Bronstad and Wiel formed a partnership, bought the bankrupt stock and moved it to Cranfills Gap where they set up a general merchandising store. After a short time in the business, Wiel decided to go back to Germany, leaving Bronstad as the sole owner of the store.</p>
		<p>On November 30, 1893 he was married, to Laura Hansen, daughter of Jurgen and Petra Foss Hansen, who lived near the Rock Church, the corner stone of which was laid in 1886. The wedding was the "talk of the town", as Bronstad had been an eligible bachelor, it would be very interesting to know how many buggies, hacks and surreys were at the hitching post on that day.</p>
		<p>To this union were born six children. Otis married Selma Tergerson. He was his dad's partner. Later, he was Postmaster in Cranfills Gap. Clyde married Louise Walton. He worked in Bronstad's Store for several years and later worked in Waco and Fort Worth. Marie married Chris Rohne. She also worked in the store until she married. Lorine married Douglas Hudson in Oklahoma. She was a nurse. Later she assisted him in their funeral business. Homer married Travis Knudson. He was a teacher, principal, superintendent and later a consultant for the Texas Education Agency. Marguerite lived at home with her parents. She helped her mother cook and do the household chores. There was often a guest or two besides the family at meals.</p>
		<p>Bronstad made many trips to markets in Waco, Dallas and St. Louis. He went by buggy to Clifton or McGregor where he left his horse and buggy at a livery stable and boarded the train for his destination. When in Waco, he stayed with his three sisters, Andrea Nelson, Carrie and Syverine. When his purchases were delivered to Clifton by train, they were hauled to the store by wagons drawn by mules.</p>
		<p>From the time that he was the sole owner, Bronstad was very active in community affairs. He worked with others in setting up a school. He operated his business finances much like a bank, extended credit, made loans to his customers and others, accepted deposits of cash, accepted drafts from other banks, etc.</p>
		<p>In 1910, with the help of J. W. Butler, he secured a loan of $10,000 from an individual in Colorado to use as the capital stock for the charter of First Guaranty State * Bank at Cranfills Gap. Bronstad was on the Board of Directors who elected him first president.
He was associated with W. T. Tergerson, Pitt Barnes and H. E. Tippet in organizing the Cranfills Gap Development Company in 1913. This organization brought about the move of the business section to its present location.</p>
		<p>In 1904, G. O. and Laura Bronstad enjoyed several days at the World's Fair in St. Louis. The Fair was in celebration of the centennial of the Louisiana Purchase.</p>
		<p>He made two trips back to Norway. Otto Reesing accompanied him on the second trip in 1914. They narrowly missed being stranded in Europe when World War I began.</p>
		<p>G. O. Bronstad died in the family home in Cranfills Gap on July 18, 1937. Chris Rohne wrote in The History of Cranfills Gap, "For fifty years until his death Bronstad's Store was the heart and soul of Cranfills Gap. He befriended many with credit, when the giving was a real sacrifice to his business and his family, but many forgot to pay him. But through it all he lived a life radiating friendship and goodwill'.

<h3>G. O. Bronstad Bosque Pioneer, Passes Away.</h3>

<p>G. O. Bronstad, pioneer Bosque County citizen, died at his home at Cranfills Gap, Sunday, July 19, 1937, at about 1:45 p. m. Funeral services were conducted Monday afternoon at the St. Olaf Lutheran Church with interment in the St. Olaf Cemetery.</p>
<p>Mr. Bronstad was born March 9, 1856, in Romedal, Hedemarken, Norway. In 1874, at the age of 18, he emigrated to the United States, coming direct to Bosque County, Texas, where he joined his brother, C. O., at Valley Mills. Here in Bosque County he at once made his home and in due time adopted this country as his own. During his long life he has been an active and contributing citizen.</p>
<p>From 1874 to 1886 he lived successively at Valley Mills, Norway Mills and Morgan, engaging in business and learning merchandising. In 1886 he moved to Cranfills Gap, and opened his business concern in Cranfills Gap. Thus Mr. Bronstad successfully rounded out more than fifty years in business in this one location.</p>
<p>In the land of his nativity he was baptized, and after proper training, was confirmed in the Lutheran Church. To this faith, confessed early in life, he remained true to the end.</p>
<p>This now departed highly respected citizen, lived a quiet, unassuming life, sincere in spirit, sympathetic, generous, and cheerful. In spite of severe experiences in business, he remained of sympathetic and kindly nature, giving service to his friends from far and near. All men were greeted with a smile in the Bronstad Store.</p>
<p>Due to the absence of his pastor, Rev. W. J. Maakestad, Rev. P. E. Thorson of Norse conducted the funeral services, assisted by Rev. O. T. Boe of Clifton and Rev. Farmer, Cranfills Gap. Inspiring music was furnished by St. Olaf Male Quartet, and by Mrs. Troll and Miss Knudson in a vocal duet.</p>
<p>Beside his wife, he leaves six children, Otis, Clyde, and Homer, Margaret, Mrs. C. L. Rohne and Mrs. Douglas Hudson. These all reside at Cranfills Gap except Mrs. Hudson, who lives in Holdenville, Okla. He is also survived by one brother, Otto, of Waco, and three sisters, Carrie and Syverine Bronstad of Waco, and Mrs Pernella Anderson, Clifton.</p>
<p>
The large gathering of sorrowing friends and relatives that overflowed the spacious church was something of an indication of the high esteem in which Mr. Bronstad was held. Representatives from every section of Bosque County, from Hamilton and Coryell Counties, came to pay tribute to a good friend, a christian gentleman, an high-class merchant, a man.</p>

   <div class="grid-item"><P><H3><a id="GO_Family"></a>Grandpa Ole Anderson Ajar Bronstad</a></H3> was born January 11, 1816, at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furnes,_Norway" target="_blank">Ajar, Furnaes, Norway</a>; and Grandma Christine Christensdatter Bronstad was born May 3, 1820 at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romedal_(village)" target="_blank">Romedal, Norway</a>. Grandpa Bronstad was a carpenter by trade. Grandpa and Grandma Bronstad had eight children as follows: Pernella (Mrs. Syver Anderson), Andreas, Christian 0., Gulbrand 0., Andrea (Mrs- Lauris Nelson), Syverine, Karen, and Otto- These all came to America except Andreas- He remained in Norway, was married, and raised a daughter. However all these three are deceased; so their line is ended.
<P> Grandpa and Grandma Bronstad came to Texas in September 1878. They made their home with the C. O. Bronstad family for many years. It is said that Grandpa Bronstad liked to go hunting, and that he had a muzzle loading shotgun. And with this he would saunter out over the pasture and bring home rabbits. Grandma Bronstad is well remembered by her grandchildren whom she loved- She was a kind and considerate Grandma who treated us with great love and concern, and whom we all loved so very much. She was a great help in the rearing of the C. 0. Bronstad family where she had her home many years. 
Grandpa Bronstad died August 31, 1891, and Grandma Bronstad died November 5, 1906. They both lie buried in Our Savior's Lutheran Church Cemetery, Norse. Texas. Their grave markers bear this inscription in Norwegian: "FRED MED DIT STOEVE - VELSIGNET VAERE DIT MINDE". Translated this is: "PEACE TO YOUR DUST-BLESSED BE YOUR MEMORY".</p><P> 
Grandpa Ovee Kjolvig was born at Jelse Sogn, the Kjolvig homestead, near Stavanger, Norway, March 27, 1825. It is said that he spent only a few months in school, he was reared and instructed from early childhood in the Lutheran Church.
His father, Torger Kjolvig, was a fisherman by trade, and their home was near the sea. It was natural then that the boy, Ovee, together with his two older brothers, Sten and Torsten, spent much of their leisure time at the seashore, watching the fishermen's boats sail out to sea, and see others returning laden with fish. The appeal of the sea was so strong, and so enticing to the brothers Kjolvig, that all three became fishermen. </p><P> 
Ovee early had a boat of his own, and was engaged in fishing, selling and shipping fish. While on one of his fishing trips off the rugged coast of Norway, his boat capsized and sank during a storm, and he narrowly escaped drowning. He was rescued in an unconscious condition, but was revived and his life saved.
On July 7, 1853, Grandpa Kjolvig was married to Johanna Margareta Naadland, also of Jelse Sogn, near Stavanger, Norway. Grandma Johanna Kjolvig was born March 17, 1831. Her home too was near the sea. In fact, her family traveled by boat when they went to church services on Sundays. One of her brothers had the distinction of being a member of the Storting (Norway's Congress).</p><P>  
She too was interested in America, and joined her husband in braving the hazards of an ocean voyage, and joining with other pioneer women with their husbands on their way to help build and enjoy this land of the free, and the home of the brave. Her sister, Bergitte Cecelia Naadland accompanied the Kjolvigs to America; she was more familiarly known as Mrs. B. C. Martin, or Aunt C. You see, Grandpa Kjolvig wanted to go to the "land of opportunity".</p><P> 
In the summer of 1854, the Kjolvigs bid farewell to their native Norway to cast their lot in a new land and there to seek their fortune and satisfaction. Their voyage across the sea was a rather eventful one. While at sea, their first child was born. He was baptized on the day of his birth and named Thomas Theodore, July 2, 1854.</p><P>  
After 15 weeks sailing, their ship reached Quebec, Canada, and Grandpa Kjolvig was a sick man with a case of cholera, so he was hospitalized. As soon as he was able to travel, the party of four set out for LaSalle County, Illinois. On their arrival there they settled almost penniless for a period of five years. And while there in Illinois, they Americanized their name, changing Kjolvig to Colwick, the name kept by the family since that time.</p><P> 
While in Illinois, the Colwicks heard glowing tales of the state of Texas, the productive lands, the grassy prairies, the wonderful climate, etc., and they turned their thoughts to Texas. They learned to know the trailblazer and colonizer, Cleng Peerson, and, being swayed by Peerson's wonderful accounts of Texas, they decided to travel to this new state as soon as possible, and there to make their permanent home.</p><P> 
Under the leadership of Cleng Peerson, a company was formed including the Colwick family then numbering four children: Thomas Theodore, Margaret, Martha and John N. Also included in the party were Miss Naadland (Aunt C) and the 0. A. Canuteson family.</p><P>  
Four long weeks were spent sailing down the Mississippi River to New Orleans. From there, another ship took them to Galveston. There they reshipped to Houston- From Houston, they traveled by ox wagon to the Neils Creek valley in Bosque County, Texas. Cleng Peerson, then growing old and not able to work as a colonizer any longer, gave half the land which the state of Texas had given him as a colonizer to Grandpa Ovee Colwick. In return for this, Mr. Peerson had a home with and was cared for by the Colwicks until his death in 1865, at the age of 82 years. He lies buried in the Norse cemetery. His grave is graced by a tall marker placed there by his friends.</p><P> 
Here in Bosque County the Colwicks built their home, settied, and spent the rest of their lives in the Neils Creek valley. When the Civil War broke out, Grandpa Colwick answered the call for service, and Grandma Colwick assumed the responsibility of holding and keeping the family and farm in order. Indians were a constant threat. At one time, three Indians came, dismounted, and walked into the home unannounced, and showed by signs that they were hungry and wanted food. Grandma calmly and hastily prepared food for them, and they ate heartily, carrying on an animated conversation in their own language. Their hunger satisfied, they rose from their chairs, bowed politely, left the house, and rode away.</p>
<P>Four sons and four daughters were born to Ovee and Johanna Colwick: Thomas Theodore, Margaret (Mrs. Dr. 0. M. Olson), Martha (Mrs. C. 0. Bronstad), John N., Sam Houston, Olivia (Mrs. T. A. Eggen), Alfred M., and Jennie Belle (Mrs. S. H. Reesing). Grandma Johanna Colwick died March 25, 1881.
On Nov. 3, 1881, Grandpa Ovee Colwick was married to Miss Mathea Erickson who had then very recently come here from Norway. To this marriage seven children were born, six growing to maturity, and they were Emil T., Millie (Mrs. Dude Cox), Clara (Mrs. A. B. Amundson), Magnus L., Agnes, and Lillie (Mrs. August Heck).
Grandpa Ovee Colwick died July 12, 1895 at the age of 70 years.
Our mother, Martha Christine, was the third child of Grandpa and Grandma Colwick. She was born May 20, 1857 in LaSalle County, Illinois. She came to Texas with her family in 1859</p>
<P>Mother attended the Peck school located on Gary creek near the "sugar loaf" mountain-Her first teacher was a Mr. Orbeck. Martha, the little girl, was very timid and scared, and the teacher's rather harsh voice did not help matters at all. However, Mr. Orbeck proved to be very kind. A Mr. Dickerman was
another teacher in this school. He kept his pistol hanging on the wall. </p>
<P>Those were the times when Indians were frequently seen, when the deer lay quietly along the path where the children walked to school, when horse thieves were manhandled, and when Bosque County was a wide open country. </p>
<P>The teacher, Mr. Dickerman, used his own system of awards to pupils excelling in some school project, For instance, when some pupil distinguished him or herself in spelling, the award was a "ticket", one by two inches, decorated with drawings of roses, etc. When a pupil had won ten of these he was given a larger "ticket", about five by seven inches, decorated by drawings of birds, hearts, roses, and complimentary inscriptions. And Mr. Dickerman signed himself as the "Preceptor of Norman Academy". Norman Hill was the name of the Post Office about two miles distant.</p>
<P>Martha and her girl friends, in their free time, enjoyed watching the boys in their rougher games. Then they played "jacks", using rocks in place of the commercialized articles used in the modern game of "jacks". Gary creek, a few yards away, offered alurements. The banks of the creek with its loose sand made excellent play space for the younger girls.
<P>There on the Colwick farm in the Neils Creek valley, our mother grew to womanhood, spinning, riding horseback, doing farm chores, and helping her parents as needs arose.</p>
<P>Grandpa Colwick was a successful farmer-stockman. However, late in his life he met with a serious accident while going about his farm work. He was attacked by a mean bull. The bull gored him in the fierce tussle. He survived the incident, but from then on he walked with crutches.</p>
<P>Our father, <H3><a name="0.C">Christian 0. Bronstad</a></H3>, the third child and second son of Grandpa and Grandma Ole Bronstad, was born August 20, 1853 in Romedal, Hedemarken, Norway. He thrived under the nurture of a beautiful country and kind parents. In due time the young boy was initiated into school work. His first school was located in a farm home. There he attended school two years. Then the "prestegjeld" or county built a school-house to which the boy was sent 
During his early teens, Christian heard glowing tales of America, the land of opportunity, of prosperity, of freedom, and of bright things awaiting a young man there. Thus this young man's mind was soon fully settled on going to America. 
<P>So when Mr. Hendrick Dahl visited back in Norway after having been in America, young Christian fell in line with a number of others, and, with Mr. Dahl as escort, bid his native land, his friends and relatives a fond farewell, and turned to America to seek his fortune. The party, on leaving Norway, set Bosque County, Texas, as their destination. In the first part of November, 1872, Christian 0. Bronstad, age 19, the young emigrant, left Norway, never to return. In Bordough [sic], France, the party was held up a few days. In Liverpool a delay of 11 days occurred.</p> 
<P>At Liverpool the party boarded the ship Louisiana of the State Line. Immediately seasickness, and no doubt homesickness too, set in. About a month was spent on the Atlantic, and for three days all passengers were shut in on account of the storms. Dad, our immigrant, landed at New Orleans, whence was carried by rail and ship to Galveston, Texas. This was a mixed ship carrying people, cattle, and everything else. Finally on Dec. 19, 1872, this immigrant arrived in Waco, Texas. </p>
<P>This was a severely cold day and the Brazos river was frozen over solid.
On arriving in Waco, young Christian was met by Peter Tingstad, one of his four acquaintances in Texas, and he helped him find employment.</p> 
<P> Young Christian landed a job as dishwasher in the "Lady Gay Restaurant", located on the square. Here he worked five days and had sleeping quarters on the second floor of the same building. Five days a resident of Waco, he fell ill with typhoid fever. </p> 
<P>After a few days, Frank Jackson, better known as Frank Bean, a Negro from Bosque County came to Waco, heard of the sick Norwegian boy, and brought him to his wagon to Bosque County. While resting on the way, Frank left the wagon for a
while and on his return carried a hat full of eggs. The sick immigrant boy was taken to the Omenson home in the Neils Creek valley. Here under the good care of Dr. Cowen, the Omensons, and the Tingstads, he was brought back to good health. However, Dr. Cowen had at one time declared that the "Little Norwegian" could not get well. Through the spring of 1873 he was too weak to work, but later he was employed in the flour mill at Valley Mills.</p> 
<P>While at Valley Mills the young miller passed through the difficulties of learning the language of the land, and the embarrassments involved. To help him in this, he subscribed to a cheap paper published in Atlanta, Ga.
After being at Valley Mills about two years, having been recommended by a Mr. Igelhart, he became the miller at Norway Mills in the Neils Creek valley. His salary was $35.00 per month, a stupendous salary at that time. </p> 
<P>Meantime his brother Gulbrand had joined him here in Bosque County. His parents and others of the family, came here in 1878.</p> 
<P>At Norway Mills he worked as miller for Mr. A. Y. Reeder who was one of the leading business men of the area. Norway Mills became quite a community center and inland town. </p> 
<P>It flourished from about 1870 to 1890. The milling business seemed to be about the biggest business to draw attention there, however, there were other businesses established in the area. Mr. Reeder, besides building the rock mill house and the two storied rock residence which still stands fully furnished, built the first cotton gin. This was a horse-powered outfit. Later, after the mill was built, the gin power was furnished from the mill by cables. Mr. Reeder also had a merchandising store, and he was Postmaster. The Post Office was established April 12, 1879. Others who held the office of Postmaster there were J. A. Lyon, John S. Odle, George J. Stapleton, Richard M. Mayfield. Mr. Mayfield continued in office until July 11, 1890 when it was discontinued.</p> 
<P>While Daddy was the miller there, Norway Mills grew to be quite a thriving business center. A Drug Store was operated by Dr. Barlow. Later Dr. 0. M. 01son had the Drug Store. And Dr. Cowan had one at one time. There were two blacksmith shops. Mr. Reeder had one and a Mr. Reed had the other one. There were other merchandising houses in operation.</p> 
<P>Then there were the photographers who seemed to drift in. They set up tents for their "photograph galleries". A Mr. Knight, a single man, had such a "gallery". Hodges and Lindgren, both swedes, set up their tent "galleries". This Mr. Hodges died from TB and was buried in the Norway Mills cemetery.</p> 
<P>It had been related that there was quite a stir the night the Reed home burned. This was on a night of preaching at the schoolhouse yes, surely there was a school at Norway Mills, there was a "traveling preacher" in charge. Mrs. Reed was in the schoolhouse meeting and became frantic, fearing that her husband was being burned to death he sometimes indulged too freely in liquor. To make things worse, Mr. Reed kept a pair of guns and a great deal of ammunition. These shells were popping off in lively fashion, and none dared to go even close to the burning building. All kept their distance. Billy Hill's house also burned. This occurred at about the time the Bronstads moved away, so Mr. Hill bought the Bronstad house.</p> 
<P>Dr. Barlow, who operated a Drug Store for some time at Norway Mills, was reportedly a rather eccentric man. However, as Drug Store operator he seemed to know his business. People reported their ills to him and he would prescribe the cures. He gave remedies for all ills whether he was an M. D. or not. He was sometimes charged with illicit sales of liquors. One thing he would not allow was to have loiterers or customers sitting on the counters. So when his wishes were not compiled with, he drove spikes up through the counters to keep them off. A cowboy came in and sat on one of the spikes, started a vi1e tirade against Mr. Barlow, and reached for his gun. At that time Mr. Barlow left for the other room.</p> 
<P>According to our Dad, who operated the mill for several years, the mill was operated by steam power. The necessary water was drawn from the branch near by, and they got plenty of wood from the hills. It was a burr system mill, two large stones, the lower one stationary, and the upper one revolving by the steam power. These stones were very heavy, about five feet in diameter, and handled by means of cranes. A hopper over the center of the top stone fed the mill. As the top stone revolved the grain was crushed and ground, and worked out around the edges. This was then caught up by elevators which carried it to the sifters. The sifters were of fine silk. By this sifting, two grades of flour were made, besides the rich bran. They also ground graham flour and corn meal. There were three sets of grindstones in this mill.
Norway Mill flour was considered to be very good. It was fine and white and made fine bread. The secret of the milling process by this system, our Dad, said, was to know just how fine to grind the flour how tight to work the millstones. It had to be ground fine enough to get the flour out, but not too fine or black specks would appear in parts of the ground up bran. Another thing that made for success of milling by the burr system was the notching or roughing of the stones. By much grinding, the stones would work slick. Then the miller, while the other stones were in action, would notch or roughen the face of the other stone. The successful miller knew just how to do this.</P>
<P>
Norway Mills marketed much flour in various parts of Texas. Waco was a regular shipping point. Much went to west Texas to Hamilton, Brownwood, and even to Stephens County. Wagons from various points came there for flour and other products. The mill also sent out its own freighters with loads of products. A Mr. Davis was such a freighter for the mill. People from near by, as well as from distant points brought their grain for grinding, would wait, and return home with their products as per orders. The mill in such cases took a one-sixth part toll for grinding.</P>
<P>There were difficulties to be met and handled in those days too. Sometimes ladies would bring grain to be processed, and would expect or want to be served first. But the rule of the mill was "first come, first served". Some of the ladies thought this was ungentlemanly conduct. Then too people would bring grain of all quantites and qualities. Often they worked far into the night to finish the day's work for their waiting customers. The quality of some of the grain was bad. Some would bring it in dirty, musty, and of very inferior quality. Yet, all would expect excellent flour from their grain.</P>
<P>Water for domestic use at "the Mill" was drawn from a common community well. The means of getting the water? A chain, a pulley, and a bucket.</P>
<P>By about 1890 the dwindling of the water supply made the continuance of the flour mill at Norway Mills inadvisable. And with the closing of the mill, Norway Mills gradually closed out as a community center. Taking its place as community centers were Hurst Springs and Norse, and these places thrived for twenty or thirty years.</P>
