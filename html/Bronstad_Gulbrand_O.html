<h2>Olson Bronstad Family</h2>		


		<p>Gulbrand Olson Bronstad was born March 9, 1856 in Romadal Hedemarken, Norway. In 1874, he emigrated to United States and came direct to Valley Mills where he spent some time with his brother Christian.</p>
		<p>From 1874 to 1886 he lived at Valley Mills, Norway Mills, Waco and Morgan during which time he learned to speak English and had a variety of business experiences.</p>
		<p>At Morgan he met Morris Wiel, bookkeeper for Miller merchandising Store. In 1887 Miller went bankrupt and Bronstad and Wiel formed a partnership, bought the bankrupt stock and moved it to Cranfills Gap where they set up a general merchandising store. After a short time in the business, Wiel decided to go back to Germany, leaving Bronstad as the sole owner of the store.</p>
		<p>On November 30, 1893 he was married, to Laura Hansen, daughter of Jurgen and Petra Foss Hansen, who lived near the Rock Church, the corner stone of which was laid in 1886. The wedding was the "talk of the town", as Bronstad had been an eligible bachelor, it would be very interesting to know how many buggies, hacks and surreys were at the hitching post on that day.</p>
		<p>To this union were born six children. Otis married Selma Tergerson. He was his dad's partner. Later, he was Postmaster in Cranfills Gap. Clyde married Louise Walton. He worked in Bronstad's Store for several years and later worked in Waco and Fort Worth. Marie married Chris Rohne. She also worked in the store until she married. Lorine married Douglas Hudson in Oklahoma. She was a nurse. Later she assisted him in their funeral business. Homer married Travis Knudson. He was a teacher, principal, superintendent and later a consultant for the Texas Education Agency. Marguerite lived at home with her parents. She helped her mother cook and do the household chores. There was often a guest or two besides the family at meals.</p>
		<p>Bronstad made many trips to markets in Waco, Dallas and St. Louis. He went by buggy to Clifton or McGregor where he left his horse and buggy at a livery stable and boarded the train for his destination. When in Waco, he stayed with his three sisters, Andrea Nelson, Carrie and Syverine. When his purchases were delivered to Clifton by train, they were hauled to the store by wagons drawn by mules.</p>
		<p>From the time that he was the sole owner, Bronstad was very active in community affairs. He worked with others in setting up a school. He operated his business finances much like a bank, extended credit, made loans to his customers and others, accepted deposits of cash, accepted drafts from other banks, etc.</p>
		<p>In 1910, with the help of J. W. Butler, he secured a loan of $10,000 from an individual in Colorado to use as the capital stock for the charter of First Guaranty State * Bank at Cranfills Gap. Bronstad was on the Board of Directors who elected him first president.
He was associated with W. T. Tergerson, Pitt Barnes and H. E. Tippet in organizing the Cranfills Gap Development Company in 1913. This organization brought about the move of the business section to its present location.</p>
		<p>In 1904, G. O. and Laura Bronstad enjoyed several days at the World's Fair in St. Louis. The Fair was in celebration of the centennial of the Louisiana Purchase.</p>
		<p>He made two trips back to Norway. Otto Reesing accompanied him on the second trip in 1914. They narrowly missed being stranded in Europe when World War I began.</p>
		<p>G. O. Bronstad died in the family home in Cranfills Gap on July 18, 1937. Chris Rohne wrote in The History of Cranfills Gap, "For fifty years until his death Bronstad's Store was the heart and soul of Cranfills Gap. He befriended many with credit, when the giving was a real sacrifice to his business and his family, but many forgot to pay him. But through it all he lived a life radiating friendship and goodwill'.

<h3>G. O. Bronstad Bosque Pioneer, Passes Away.</h3>

<p>G. O. Bronstad, pioneer Bosque County citizen, died at his home at Cranfills Gap, Sunday, July 19, 1937, at about 1:45 p. m. Funeral services were conducted Monday afternoon at the St. Olaf Lutheran Church with interment in the St. Olaf Cemetery.</p>
<p>Mr. Bronstad was born March 9, 1856, in Romedal, Hedemarken, Norway. In 1874, at the age of 18, he emigrated to the United States, coming direct to Bosque County, Texas, where he joined his brother, C. O., at Valley Mills. Here in Bosque County he at once made his home and in due time adopted this country as his own. During his long life he has been an active and contributing citizen.</p>
<p>From 1874 to 1886 he lived successively at Valley Mills, Norway Mills and Morgan, engaging in business and learning merchandising. In 1886 he moved to Cranfills Gap, and opened his business concern in Cranfills Gap. Thus Mr. Bronstad successfully rounded out more than fifty years in business in this one location.</p>
<p>In the land of his nativity he was baptized, and after proper training, was confirmed in the Lutheran Church. To this faith, confessed early in life, he remained true to the end.</p>
<p>This now departed highly respected citizen, lived a quiet, unassuming life, sincere in spirit, sympathetic, generous, and cheerful. In spite of severe experiences in business, he remained of sympathetic and kindly nature, giving service to his friends from far and near. All men were greeted with a smile in the Bronstad Store.</p>
<p>Due to the absence of his pastor, Rev. W. J. Maakestad, Rev. P. E. Thorson of Norse conducted the funeral services, assisted by Rev. O. T. Boe of Clifton and Rev. Farmer, Cranfills Gap. Inspiring music was furnished by St. Olaf Male Quartet, and by Mrs. Troll and Miss Knudson in a vocal duet.</p>
<p>Beside his wife, he leaves six children, Otis, Clyde, and Homer, Margaret, Mrs. C. L. Rohne and Mrs. Douglas Hudson. These all reside at Cranfills Gap except Mrs. Hudson, who lives in Holdenville, Okla. He is also survived by one brother, Otto, of Waco, and three sisters, Carrie and Syverine Bronstad of Waco, and Mrs Pernella Anderson, Clifton.</p>
<p>
The large gathering of sorrowing friends and relatives that overflowed the spacious church was something of an indication of the high esteem in which Mr. Bronstad was held. Representatives from every section of Bosque County, from Hamilton and Coryell Counties, came to pay tribute to a good friend, a christian gentleman, an high-class merchant, a man.</p>
