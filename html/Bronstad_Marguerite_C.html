<h3>
<img class="mlr114px"  src="../pic/Pinky/Gulbrand-pinky.png" alt="Gulbrand pic">G. O. Bronstad Bosque Pioneer, Passes Away. </h3>
<p>G. O. Bronstad, pioneer Bosque County citizen, died at his home at Cranfills Gap, Sunday, July 19, 1937, at about 1:45 p. m. Funeral services were conducted Monday afternoon at the St. Olaf Lutheran Church with interment in the St. Olaf Cemetery.</p>
<p>Mr. Bronstad was born March 9, 1856, in Romedal, Hedemarken, Norway. In 1874, at the age of 18, he emigrated to the United States, coming direct to Bosque County, Texas, where he joined his brother, C. O., at Valley Mills. Here in Bosque County he at once made his home and in due time adopted this country as his own. During his long life he has been an active and contributing citizen.</p>
<p>From 1874 to 1886 he lived successively at Valley Mills, Norway Mills and Morgan, engaging in business and learning merchandising. In 1886 he moved to Cranfills Gap, and opened his business concern in Cranfills Gap. Thus Mr. Bronstad successfully rounded out more than fifty years in business in this one location.</p>
<p>
In the land of his nativity he was baptized, and after proper training, was confirmed in the Lutheran Church. To this faith, confessed early in life, he remained true to the end.</p>
<p>This now departed highly respected citizen, lived a quiet, unassuming life, sincere in spirit, sympathetic, generous, and cheerful. In spite of severe experiences in business, he remained of sympathetic and kindly nature, giving service to his friends from far and near. All men were greeted with a smile in the Bronstad Store.</p>
<p>Due to the absence of his pastor, Rev. W. J. Maakestad, Rev. P. E. Thorson of Norse conducted the funeral services, assisted by Rev. O. T. Boe of Clifton and Rev. Farmer, Cranfills Gap. Inspiring music was furnished by St. Olaf Male Quartet, and by Mrs. Troll and Miss Knudson in a vocal duet.</p>
<p>Beside his wife, he leaves six children, Otis, Clyde, and Homer, <mark>Margaret</mark>, Mrs. C. L. Rohne and Mrs. Douglas Hudson. These all reside at Cranfills Gap except Mrs. Hudson, who lives in Holdenville, Okla. He is also survived by one brother, Otto, of Waco, and three sisters, Carrie and Syverine Bronstad of Waco, and Mrs Pernella Anderson, Clifton.</p>
<p>The large gathering of sorrowing friends and relatives that overflowed the spacious church was something of an indication of the high esteem in which Mr. Bronstad was held. Representatives from every section of Bosque County, from Hamilton and Coryell Counties, came to pay tribute to a good friend, a christian gentleman, an high-class merchant, a man.

<h4>H. F. Hansen Dies Suddenly Friday </h4>
<p>Hans Ferdinand Hansen was born Dec. 24, 1886. His parents were Hans Jorgen Hansen and Petra Foss Hansen. He was baptized in infancy at the St. Olaf Rock Church, and later renewed his baptismal covenant on the day of his confirmation, June 15, 1902, being confirmed by the Rev. J. K. Rystad.</p>
<p>He attended public and parochial schools under Prof. A. H. Denby Olsen and attended Clifton College in 1904.</p>
<p>He was united in marriage to Gena Marie Tergerson on Aug. 2, 1906 by the Rev. G. G. Odengaard. To this union were born five daughters, two of whom died in infancy. He is survived by his wife and three daughters, Jewel Pauline (Mrs. Alton Tindall of Phillips, Texas; Wilma Adeline (Mrs. Oscar Knudson) of Carlsbad, New Mexico, and Frances Lee (Mrs. Samuel Coffey) of Winslow, Arizona, and three grandchildren, A. W. Tindall, Jr., Mary Joyce Tindall and Roger Lane Coffey. He also leaves to mourn his passing, six sisters, Mrs. Mary Gaustad, Mrs. J. T. Jenson, Mrs. G. O. Bronstad and Mrs. Newman Hastings, all of Cranfills Gap; Mrs E. E. Erickson of Clifton and Mrs. Jennie Jermstad of Fort Worth, together with a large host of more distant relatives and friends.</p>
<p>Mr. Hansen and his bride settled on the Jorgen Hansen homestead, one of the most beautiful and imposing country homes in this section, pre-empted by his parents many years before, his Father and mother having come from Denmark and Norway respectively. In the atmosphere of parental love and devotion he and his loving wife reared their children, in mutual love and happiness, until the day of his sad and sudden departure.</p>
<p>He came to assume responsibility early in life, his father passing away when, Ferdie, as he was always called, was only twelve years old. Being the only son and the youngest in the family, his responsibilities were even greater. But he grew into manhood under steady Christian influence and became a pillar in the church and community, and serving as a trustee of the local Lutheran Church at the time of his death. All who knew Mr. Hansen loved him because of his kind and pleasing disposition. Likewise he loved his friends and neighbors and enjoyed every association, making the most of the more beautiful things of life. He loved and was loved. Deep in his heart there was more tenderness, more understanding, more genuine love and affection for his family and fellowmen than you find in any man, save and except the most deeply consecrated souls.</p>
<p>He departed this life at 1:45 o'clock Friday morning, June 12, 1942, at the age of 55 years, 5 months and 18 days. Without and seeming premonition, he had lived that he might depart to his Savior, suddenly. He prayed fervently that he may be allowed to live, but said, "All would be well."

On November 30, 1893, she was united in marriage to G. O. Bronstad at the old Rock Church near the old Hanson[sic] home. To this union were born six children, three sons, Otis and Clyde of Cranfills Gap, and Homer of Vernon; three daughters, Marie, Mrs. Chris Rohne, and <b>Marguerite</b>, both of Cranfills Gap, and Lorine, Mrs Douglas Hudson, of Holdenville, Oklahoma.
