<h4>H. F. Hansen Dies Suddenly Friday </h4>
<p>Hans Ferdinand Hansen was born Dec. 24, 1886. His parents were Hans Jorgen Hansen and Petra Foss Hansen. He was baptized in infancy at the St. Olaf Rock Church, and later renewed his baptismal covenant on the day of his confirmation, June 15, 1902, being confirmed by the Rev. J. K. Rystad.</p>
<p>He attended public and parochial schools under Prof. A. H. Denby Olsen and attended Clifton College in 1904.</p>
<p>He was united in marriage to Gena Marie Tergerson on Aug. 2, 1906 by the Rev. G. G. Odengaard. To this union were born five daughters, two of whom died in infancy. He is survived by his wife and three daughters, Jewel Pauline (Mrs. Alton Tindall of Phillips, Texas; Wilma Adeline (Mrs. Oscar Knudson) of Carlsbad, New Mexico, and Frances Lee (Mrs. Samuel Coffey) of Winslow, Arizona, and three grandchildren, A. W. Tindall, Jr., Mary Joyce Tindall and Roger Lane Coffey. He also leaves to mourn his passing, six sisters, Mrs. Mary Gaustad, Mrs. J. T. Jenson, Mrs. G. O. Bronstad and Mrs. Newman Hastings, all of Cranfills Gap; Mrs E. E. Erickson of Clifton and Mrs. Jennie Jermstad of Fort Worth, together with a large host of more distant relatives and friends.</p>
<p>Mr. Hansen and his bride settled on the Jorgen Hansen homestead, one of the most beautiful and imposing country homes in this section, pre-empted by his parents many years before, his Father and mother having come from Denmark and Norway respectively. In the atmosphere of parental love and devotion he and his loving wife reared their children, in mutual love and happiness, until the day of his sad and sudden departure.</p>
<p>He came to assume responsibility early in life, his father passing away when, Ferdie, as he was always called, was only twelve years old. Being the only son and the youngest in the family, his responsibilities were even greater. But he grew into manhood under steady Christian influence and became a pillar in the church and community, and serving as a trustee of the local Lutheran Church at the time of his death. All who knew Mr. Hansen loved him because of his kind and pleasing disposition. Likewise he loved his friends and neighbors and enjoyed every association, making the most of the more beautiful things of life. He loved and was loved. Deep in his heart there was more tenderness, more understanding, more genuine love and affection for his family and fellowmen than you find in any man, save and except the most deeply consecrated souls.</p>
<p>He departed this life at 1:45 o'clock Friday morning, June 12, 1942, at the age of 55 years, 5 months and 18 days. Without and seeming premonition, he had lived that he might depart to his Savior, suddenly. He prayed fervently that he may be allowed to live, but said, "All would be well." The Lord saw fit to call him home to his heavenly mansions, that he might live in glorious eternity and share early his eternal reward.</p>
<p>Funeral services were conducted from the home at 3:00 o'clock and from the Lutheran Church in Cranfills gap at 3:30 o'clock Sunday afternoon. Interment was made in the St Olaf Cemetery, with Rev. B. R. Maakestad officiating at all services.</p>
<p>Active pall bearers were Messrs. Jurgen Gaustad, Ennis Erickson, Clyde Bronstad, Homer Hastings, Justin Jenson and Walter A. Hanson. Honorary pall bearers were Messrs. S. A. Hanson, C. O. Johnson, Martin Hoel, Tilden Hastings, K. M. Knudson, J. E. Bryn, John Dahl Waldemar Olson, Hubbert Olson, Willie Schibler, S. C. Knudson, G. S. Knudson, W. P. Tindall, Otto C. Pederson and Charley Hoel.</p>
<p>A male quartet consisting of A. C. Grimland, T. S. Tergerson, O. C. Knudson and Levi Bryn sang, "Will the Circle Be Unbroken," at the home and "There Will Be Sunrise For Me" was sung at the church. Mesdames Clyde and Binous Tindall also sang "Good Night Here but Good Morning Up There."</p>
<p>Flower girls were Mrs. Paul Christenson, Loverne and Geraldine Rohne, Mrs. Leroy Troll, Marguerite Bronstad, Rosa Lee Hastings, Maurine Rohne, Junelle Jenson and Gene Knudson.</p>

To this union were born six children, three sons, Otis and Clyde of Cranfills Gap, and Homer of Vernon; three daughters, Marie, Mrs. Chris Rohne, and Marguerite, both of Cranfills Gap, and Lorine, Mrs Douglas Hudson, of Holdenville, Oklahoma. Besides the above children she is survived by thirteen grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bronstad lived a life of deep Christian conviction and devotion to her church. She lived a life of complete surrender to her Saviour. She was sure in her faith and true to her Lord. In this assurance she lived a joyful life. The unselfish love for her family and friends will long be remembered. May god bless her memory.</p>
