<br>
    <p>Will Walton's parents were multi-generation Ameericans. </p><br>
    <p>Will's Fatther, was from an intermitent, patrilineal, line of Preacher--Farmers ( Barren, KY ðŸ ¤ Louisa, VA ðŸ ¤ Henrico, VA, British Colonial America ðŸ ¤  St. Peter's Parish, New Kent, VA, British Colonial America ðŸ ¤  Seaton, Devon, England, United Kingdom in 1628.).  The family of <a HREF="https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/about/L2QL-XFX " TARGET="_BLANK">Reverend William Walton</A> arrived in the year 1635 at Hingham, Massachusetts Bay Colony, British Colonial America. </p><br>

<p>Will's Mother, Williamina America Wood, was of a line of Farmers (Metcalfe Co. Ky,  ðŸ ¤ VA, British Colonial America.) Her father, Twyman Wood (1801 -1883), owned 6 slaves according to "United States Census (Slave Schedule, 1860).  Her grandfather, William Johnson Wood owned 15 according to the same slave census. Earlier records for the Wood line are fewer, but clearly that line was in America in the early 18th century, if not sooner.
<br><br>
 <BLOCKQUOTE CLASS="gwbt">&nbsp;&nbsp;It's discomforting to know that I descend from multiple lines of American slave holders. Much of the comforts and ease I and my predecessors knew came at the expense of unwilling, compelled men, women and children of dark skin, and their enslaved descendants.<br><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;Afro Americans labored for the wealth my ancestors accumulated, but few Blacks could accumulate much wealth beyone the skills they acquired.    
 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not simply to condemn my line, history has done much of that. A significant portion of the wealth, that in the form of owned humans, simply evaporated after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation" target="_blank">The Emancipation Proclamation</a> was enforced. The proclamation could not lift the burdens of racial misinformation and "otherness" that yet poison national harmony. And reparations are somehow in order, but that is politically difficult.
  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;More daunting is the awareness that in future our present casual abuse of Mother Earth and the other forms of life about us, may reap punishment orders of magnitudes greater than the punishments of the American Civil War and mid 20<sup>th</sup> century desegregation. Just as my forefathers could ignore the moral and practical implications of their error with slavery, we today ignore the moral and practical implications of or errors with this world. Just as Washington and Jefferson bought and used slaves, we eat animals and burn petrochemicals. I find it blind hypocricy to condemn the 19 <sup>th</sup> century Wood family while driving to McDonalds for a Big Mac.</blockquote><br>

<h4><a id="FredDeath">&nbsp;</a>1915-05-14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Child [Frederick Walton] Meets Tragic Death </h4>
<p> An accident which resulted in the instant death of Frederick Walton the little five year old son of Mr. and Mrs. Will Walton of Blue Ridge, occurred Wednesday afternoon at about 3:30 o'clock near the residence of W. O. O'Bannon, four miles from Hamilton.
<br><br>
The little boy was riding in a wagon in which his uncle, Tom Walton, was hauling a hay press. The child was standing near the press, when an upright lever caught in a low telephone wire, toppling over the press. It is supposed the child jumped from the wagon, the press falling out of the wagon on him, crushing him to death instantly.--<u>Hamilton Herald</u>. </p>
<blockquote class="gwb">Grandfather Will Walton said of Frederick,"We knew Fred was uncommon, he was always pleased with whatever we gave him or did for him. We had expecrted great things of such a disposition, but now he is gone."<br><br>The pain of this loss struck not only parents, siblings, Aunts and Uncles; the pain has become part of the patrimony of the next generation. <br><br>
Mother took care that I, as a child, then later as an adult visited <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/19979160/frederick-cook-walton" target="_blank">Uncle Frederick's grave</a>. (You can visit too, vicariously, by clicking the link.)

<h4>1924-10-03&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <b><u>Hamilton Herald-Record</b></u></h4>
<p> W. T. Walton, one of Hamiltor county's best citizens and a prosperous farmer, was a pleasant business caller in the Herald-Record office last Saturday afternoon. While here he informed us that his daughter, <a href="Walton_Annie_Joy_Walton.html" target="_blank">Miss Annie Walton</a> had returned to John Tarleton College in Stephenville for her last year in that institution. <a href="Walton_Aubrey_Gilkes.html" target="_blank">Miss Aubrey Walton</a>, who graduated from Tarleton last spring, will teach with her brother, <a href="Walton_William_E.html" target="_blank">Prof. Embrey Walton</a>, in the Shive school this year. This family of young folks are ambitious and are attaining to great usefulness in their school work, and a legion of friends wish for their continued success and happiness.</p>

<blockquote class="gwb">I get the impression of a man who was "bustin his buttons" with Fatherly pride. Wouldn't suffice to simply talk up his children to the fellows on the Hamilton courthouse square, or congenial congregants of his church. Nothing less than the entire literati in the reach of the <u>Hamilton Herald</u> would do. <br><br>
And it was quite an achievement for each sibling; homework hours were sandwiched between farm chores and the limited availability of kerosene lamps and oil for night reading light.<br><br>
And it was an achievement for Will and Ethel who could manage to send each child to school and continue to run the farm with a declining family work force. 
</blockquote>
<h4>1935</h4>
<p>Ethel Walton's youngest sister, Great Aunt Grace Embrey (1899 - 1990) wed (16 June 1917)  Leonard Aubrey Eubanks (27 September 1897-22 October 1934, Breckenridge, Stephens, Texas)</p>
<p>L. A. Eubanks was chief Engineer of Brooks Gasoline Plant, he died of heart exhaustion, pheumonia + toxemia from accidental burns covering 1/3 of his body.</P>

<p>A desperate Grace had children ages 4, 8, 10, 13, 14 and 15. Some (all?) of them were routed among relatives for care and sustenance. These children were Ethyl Walton's nieces and nephews. Anetha Jean Eubank, the 13 year old, whom we later knew as Dink told us she and the other children hated it when it was time to live with Will and Ethyl. Ethyl was an awful cook and Will Walton a stern disciplinarian; they had to eat all their food.</P>

<blockquote class="gwb">Some families migrated westward as near family units. Most of the family of my Great Grandfather Bronstad from Hedemarken, Norway eventually came, in 3 or more travelling groups, to the Norwegian area of Bosque County, TX. Most of Claiborne Walton's children came with him from Kentucky to Hamilton County, TX. Some of James Monroe Cameron's brothers come from Tippah, Mississippi to join him in Hamilton, Texas. In familial union, more could be done; in times of crisis, help was at hand, children were cared for. <br><br>
