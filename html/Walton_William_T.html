<blockquote class="Cr2"><img class="mlr" src="../pic/Pinky/FlorenceAnnWalton-pinky.png" alt="picture Florence Ann Walton">  <sup class="footnote"> [1]</sup>My great aunt, <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/details/KPS3-Y5L" target="_blank"> Ina (Walton) Hicks</a> and <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/details/L7JV-4G4" target="_blank"> Dr. Hicks</a> lived in Moline [TX.] and I loved to go visit them. Dr. Hicks died when I was only three years old, but I have very fond and vivid memories of him. No wonder, he always wore a three-piece suit and had a long white beard and mustache. He kept a pocket watch in his vest pocket which chimed. I would sit in his lap, listen to the watch, chime, and play with his beard. He was the first person that I ever knew who died. Because I was so young, the concept of dying was hard for me to understand, and I kept wanting him to come back and play with me. I loved staying with Aunt Ina. She had feather beds and I especially liked to stay with her in the winter when I could snuggle down in the feather bed and get all nice and warm. She would also heat bricks to put in our bed to warm the covers and to keep our feet warm. <br>
In 1946, <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/details/LYG4-T1Q" target="_blank"> Horace</A> and <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/details/LY7X-HGB" target="_blank"> Robbie Walton</A> took Papaw [James Cross Walton] and Aunt Ina to Kentucky to visit all their nieces. We also went out in the country, near Horse Cave, Kentucky. To visit the old [William Claiborne] Walton home place. There wasn’t a house there any longer, but they enjoyed seeing the place where it had been. Aunt Ina told a funny story that the old home place reminded her of. When she was a very small child it was the time when children were seen, but not heard. One Sunday her parents had the preacher over for dinner and fried chicken was on the menu. The children had all been sent to another room while the adults ate first, But Aunt Ina was peeking through the door. She saw the preacher about the spear, the chicken gizzard and she yelled out "Save the gizzard for me". I think she got into quite a lot of trouble because of the chicken gizzard.

<sup class="footnote"> [2]</sup>My own grandfather, <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/details/KJC5-P1H" target="_blank"> <img class="mlr" src="../pic/Pinky/JimWalton-pinky.png" alt="picture of Jim Walton"> James Cross Walton</a> (Papaw) always was and always will be the most special person in the world to me. Robbie summed it up best when she said "Papaw and Florence and don’t just love each other, it’s more like mutual adoration". We spent many wonderful hours together, riding horses, singing together, going to cattle auctions, and him reading and telling me stories of the “good old" days. I was the very first person in our entire family to get the mumps. Mother and Daddy were intent on staying away from me so they wouldn’t get infected. I just stayed in my room and they brought in my food and then dashed right out. Papaw felt sorry for me and started staying in the room with me all time, keeping me company. Sure enough, he came down with the mumps and was very very sick. He would have been in his late 60s at that time.

<br>
  <p><mark>Will Walton's</mark> parents were multi-generation Americans. </p><br>
  <p>Will's Father, was from an intermittent, patrilineal, line of Preacher--Farmers ( Barren, KY &lArr; Louisa, VA &lArr; Henrico, VA, British Colonial America &lArr; St. Peter's Parish, New Kent, VA, British Colonial America &lArr; Seaton, Devon, England, United Kingdom in 1628.). The family of <a HREF="https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/about/L2QL-XFX " TARGET="_BLANK"> Reverend William Walton</A> arrived in the year 1635 at Hingham, Massachusetts Bay Colony, British Colonial America. </p><br>

<blockquote class="Cr2"><img class="mlr" src="../pic/Pinky/InaJo-pinky.png" alt="picture Ina Jo (Walton) Mapp">&nbsp;&nbsp;
William Claibourne Walton, son of William Asbury and Mariah Smith Walton, was born 8 April 1832 in Barren County, Kentucky. About 1865 in Kentucky, he married Williamina America "Ina" Wood. The family lived in Munfordville, Hart County, Kentucky in 1860, 1870, 1880. In 1890, the Walton family left Munfordville with six of their unmarried children and boarded the train for Abilene, Texas. When the found most of the terrritory was ranch land, they moved to Falls County where they raised one year's crop at Chilton before moving on the Blue Ridge place in Hamilton County. They had ten children of which nine were living in 1900.</p>
<p>Barrett and mate Suzie also left Kentucky and joined the family later. The children were Lilian, Cora, Frank and Nora. The older girls married Blackwells. Frank’s mate was Emma Perry and Nora married Ray V Davis. Buford and Lula Grubbs married and their child was Maud. Annie, already married in Kentucky brought her husband A B Craddock and children Susie, Elizabeth, Irene, George, Hattie, Grant, Agnes and Annie Buford to Hamilton, but soon return to their native state Kentucky. </p>
<p>Family members were active in both the Methodist and Baptist churches. -Ina Jo Mapp

<hr>
<p>Will's Mother, Williamina America Wood, was of a line of Farmers (Metcalfe Co. Ky, &lArr; VA, British Colonial America.) Her father, Twyman Wood (1801 -1883), owned 6 slaves according to "United States Census (Slave Schedule, 1860). Her grandfather, William Johnson Wood owned 15 according to the same slave census. Earlier records for the Wood line are fewer, but clearly that line was in America in the early 18th century, if not sooner.

 <blockquote class="Cr1"><img class="mlr" src="../pic/Pinky/Walt-pinky.png" alt="picture Walt Bronstad">
 &nbsp;It's discomforting to know that I descend from multiple lines of American slave holders. Much of the comforts and ease I and my predecessors knew came at the expense of unwilling, compelled men, women and children of dark skin, and their enslaved descendants.<br><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;Afro Americans labored for the wealth my ancestors accumulated, but few Blacks could accumulate much wealth beyond the skills they acquired.  
 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not simply to condemn my line, history has done much of that. A significant portion of the wealth, that in the form of owned humans, simply evaporated after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation" target="_blank"> The Emancipation Proclamation</a> was enforced. The proclamation could not lift the burdens of racial misinformation and "otherness" that yet poison national harmony. And reparations are somehow in order, but that issue is a moral, political, economic and pragmatic quagmire.
 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;More daunting is the awareness that in future our present casual abuse of Mother Earth and the multitude of living forms who share Mother Earth with us, may reap punishment orders of magnitudes greater than the punishments of the American Civil War and mid 20<sup>th</sup> century desegregation. Just as my forefathers could ignore the moral and practical implications of their error with slavery, we today ignore the moral and practical implications of or errors with this world. Just as Washington and Jefferson bought and used slaves, we eat animals and burn petrochemicals. I find it blind hypocrisy to condemn the 19 <sup>th</sup> century Wood family while driving to McDonalds for a Big Mac.</blockquote><br>

<p>  <mark>William Twyman Walton</mark>  of Texas attended the Dental School 1899-1900. </p>
<blockquote class="Cy2"><img class="mlr" src="../pic/Pinky/Walt-pinky.png" alt="picture Walt Bronstad">&nbsp;&nbsp; Mother told me her Father, <b>W. T. Walton</b>, was interested in dentistry; he even had some teeth for study in his storage chest. A librarian at Vanderbilt University confirmed that <b>Will Walton</b> attended the Dental School 1899-1900. <br><br>
I've found no clue why Grandfather did not continue with dentistry. One can point to his marriage to Ethel (Embrey) Price 17 December 1901. I believe he found more delight in watching his food crops and farm animals grow than in looking into the diseased mouths and fearful faces of patients on whom he may have to inflict pain.

<h4><a id="FredDeath"> </a>1915-05-14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Child [<img class="mlr" src="../pic/Pinky/Frederick-pinky.png" alt="picture Frederick"> Frederick Walton] Meets Tragic Death </h4>
<p> An accident which resulted in the instant death of Frederick Walton the little five year old son of <mark>Mr. and Mrs. Will Walton</mark>  of Blue Ridge, occurred Wednesday afternoon at about 3:30 o'clock near the residence of W. O. O'Bannon, four miles from Hamilton.
<br><br>
The little boy was riding in a wagon in which his uncle, Tom Walton, was hauling a hay press. The child was standing near the press, when an upright lever caught in a low telephone wire, toppling over the press. It is supposed the child jumped from the wagon, the press falling out of the wagon on him, crushing him to death instantly.--<u>Hamilton Herald</u>. </p>
<blockquote class="Cy2"><img class="mlr" src="../pic/Pinky/Walt-pinky.png" alt="picture Walt Bronstad">&nbsp;&nbsp; Grandfather <b>Will Walton</b> said of Frederick,"We knew Fred was uncommon, he was always pleased with whatever we gave him or did for him. We had expected great things of such a disposition, but now he is gone."<br><br>The pain of this loss struck not only parents, siblings, Aunts and Uncles; the pain has become part of the patrimony of the next generation. <br><br>

<blockquote class="Cy2"><h4>&nbsp;<img class="mlr" src="../pic/Pinky/Embrey-pinky.png" alt="picture Embrey Walton">&nbsp;W. E. WALTON FAMILY</h4>
[I spe]nt most of the first quarter, Twentieth century, in Hamilton County. I had diptheria during babyhood and Dr Jas [?] administered toxin-antitoxin; [?]dly the first used in the county. 
[?]v buildings erected on the square [?]e square paved by a huge horse-[powered] rock crusher. There were phonographs-and motorcycles before electric [lights and] indoor plumbing, telephones, w[indow] screens were commonplace. [fin]ally cars, then trucks, replaced bug[gies and h]acks, surreys and wagons; then gas [station]s and garages superseded livery [stables] and blacksmith shops. Roads were [improv]ed consistently.
<br><br>
[I was]thrilled by the first railroad from [Gates]ville: awed by dynamite blasts and [bridge]s as more tracks were constructed [between G]atesville and Comanche. Soon after [the las]t track was built, a big rain washed [out a s]mall bridge a few blocks north of the [Hamilt}on station. The first rail worker fatal[ity the] first car-train death in the county, I [?]  happened within two miles of my [?]bd home.
<br><br>
Haley's comet was a familiar sight in [the night.] I wondered if I might see its next [appear]ance (due 1986). A one-day excur[sion to] Waco's Cotton Palace was exciting. [The fir]st airplane I saw was piloted by [?]n Stinson during a carnival picnic [?]ly. Circuses in the fall were interest[ing, fi]shing and hunting, when it was too cold for field work, play at school [ and so]metimes a family picnic, constituted [most o]f our recreation.
<br><br>
[Som]etimes from home, a few miles [north] east of Hamilton, a heavy pall of [smoke]from four cotton gins, two cotton [seed o]il mills, a compress, flour mill, etc. [gave th]e town an industrial appearance, or [warne]d us for an approaching "Blue Norther".
<br><br>
[We] were thrilled by music of visiting U.S. [Army] and plane training flights after war [was d]eclared, April 1917. We rejoiced in [the ar]mistice celebration in 1918 and then [were s]addened within the next few months by many flu deaths.
<br><br>
[In th]e fall of 1918 we could see light from [a bur]ning oil well near Desdemonia, [in Coma]nche County. Soon many giant [wood]en derricks sprang up in the county [?]e in oil searching - no concern for [?]en. The wonder of radio followed [quickly.]
<br><br>
[On] May 5, 1915, the tragic death of my [broth]er. Frederick, age five, distressed us [esp]ecially my parents. One consolation [was i]n the words of King David, "I cannot [bring] him back but can go to him". Little [thought] now that forty-two years later I would [lose th]e only son I had at that time, Embrey. [?]nd again be consoled as before plus [grant]ded assurance gained through years of Bible study.
<br><br>
[Aft]er fifty-two years in Fort Worth, Hamil[ton is still "Home". My parents were Wm and Ethel Walton. My first wife and I had three children, Janetha. Embry. Jr. and Nan.  Alter my tirst wife's death I married Beulah and we have Emily and Paul. All five have enviable records of which I am very proud. I also have four grandchildren and [?]great-grandchildren. I have four sisters, Aubrey, Annie, Louise, and Ina. W. E. Walton.

<blockquote class="Cg2"><img class="mlr" src="../pic/Pinky/Walt-pinky.png" alt="picture Walt Bronstad">&nbsp;&nbsp; I get the impression of a man who was "bustin his buttons" with Fatherly pride. Wouldn't suffice to simply talk up his children to the fellows on the Hamilton courthouse square, or congenial congregants of his church. Nothing less than the entire literati in the reach of the <u>Hamilton Herald</u> would do. <br><br>
And it was quite an achievement for each sibling; homework hours were sandwiched between farm chores and the limited availability of kerosene lamps and oil for night reading light.<br><br>
And it was an achievement for  <mark>Will and Ethell</mark>   who could manage to send each child to school and continue to run the farm with a declining family work force.

Claibourne had to change church to Church of Christ to close the deal.</p>
<blockquote class="Cg2"><img class="mlr" src="../pic/Pinky/Walt-pinky.png" alt="picture Walt Bronstad">&nbsp;&nbsp; Well after Will's death in 1957, when the land was being divided among the siblings, Mother and I drove on the gravel road within the "ranch", land Will had used to graze cattle. It's an undulating section of land, covered in grass and live oak trees. At the 'top' of the section were rude shelter and feeder troughs. 
<br><br>
WIll would feed the cattle frequently throughout the week; that let him check on his cattle, to see if any were injured or in calf and other such work of herdsmen. The road hugged the fencelines, wherever terrain and live oak clusters permitted, so as to ease the job of checking the fence. 
<br><br>
But that day, Mother crept slower than usual along the rough rutted road, seeking Claibourne's shack. It took Claibourne long, isolated nights of wrestling with his soul before he could find a way to meet Leone's demand to change to her family's church.
<br><br>
At the time, I inferred Claibourne had built a retreat shack, but after having read Grace (Embrey) Eubanks account of James Monroe Embreys settling near Hamilton, " Later there were other small houses done on the ranch near Bear Creek--moving closer to town each time they were built", I now infer Claibourne squatted in an abandoned house/shack.

 <h4>The Walton‘s family garden scarecrow.</h4>

Big Whitey had hardly crowded his shrill “cock-a-doodle-doo“ from that stout leghorn neck when  <mark>William Twyman Walton</mark>  opened his big blue eyes and bounded to the floor, exclaiming "Gosh-o-landin', Ethel, like brother Barret would say, I should have been up an hour ago.
<br><br>
One of Will's chief delights was to relate a humorous incident or one that evoked pleasure. So he smiled to himself as he anticipated the day's plowing, while lighting the kindling and wood in the cook stove as he listened intermittently to the "potrack" of the guineas and gobble of the turkeys, hoping that some noise from Ethel, Embrey, Aubrey, Annie Joy, Louise, or Ina would announce other awakenings.
<br><br>
He reminisced about the cattle drives that he and other cowboys made to Kansas market a few years ago.
<br><br>
While filling the kettle with water for oatmeal, he proceeded to grind fresh coffee beans in the grinder that was attached to the wall. During this time, he continued to drop just as many pans and pots as possible to arouse the family. When these clatters failed to awake anyone except Ethel, he recited in his unmistakable loud tenor voice, the little Irish poem;
<ul style="list-style-type:none;" class="cursive">
<li>Jackie and Jennie </li>
<li>they lived in the rye,</li>
<li>They had a little baby </li>
<li>with one black eye.</li>
<br>
<li>"Jennie", said Jackie, </li>
<li>"let's knock it in the head."</li>
<li>"No Jackie," said Jennie, </li>
<li>"let's buy it some bread.</li>
<br>
<li>You buy it one loaf</li>
<li>and I'll buy it two. </li>
<li>We'll bring up our children </li>
<li>like other folks do."</li>
</ul>
<br>
Poems pleased the children. Hearing Papa sing or recite poetry early in the morning meant that he had not been lately too upset by some unpleasant incident, as a pole cat absconding under the back porch, or some similar happening.
<br><br>
When the usual chores such as lunch fixing were completed, the four older children loaded into the surrey. The son, Embrey, who was the oldest, was in the driver's seat, with his feet braced tight against the buckboard. Will gave him the usual admonition to "look after the girls" as Old Mark, the faithful old buggy horse scurried down the lane past the O'Bannons', Brother Tom Walton's, the Stuckeys' and Browns' on the way to school.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Ethel finished pounding the dasher in the wooden churn for fresh butter and remarked to Ina, the youngest daughter, that today they would take a broom and some old clothes out to the upper garden to make a scarecrow. This would frighten those pesky birds from the English peas, lettuce, and radishes. Tar Baby, Ina's black puppy, tagged along behind Ethel and Ina as they dressed up the old broom into a staunch and distinctive scarecrow.
<br><br>
Will hitched his mule team of Beck and Moodin to the nearest fencepost when he drove into view of the grotesque figure standing there, and armed with his horse-whip, decided to investigate. Imagine the jovial occasion his discovery afforded!

Once, Bobby, then four, getting out of the car to investigate a signal of trouble, and anticipating mechanical opportunities, clapped his hands and jubilantly cried,<br><br>"O Boy, look, Mommy, a flat!"

We still walk over grasslands where my grandfather J. M. Embrey, nearly a century ago had hundreds of sheep west of Hamilton.
<br><br>
The creek still runs part time that cooled my mother's feet and furnished mud to relieve her bee stings as she helped her father. Depressions remain where massive rocks were removed to build structures in town. Recently we found a fossil gastropod under a massive oak where my mother had played.
<br><br>
We still see the wild flowers coloring the pastures. The blue bells, winecups, Indian blankets, and paint brushes are still there.
We see the cedars clutching the hillsides, the oak clusters cleared goat-high, the willows with thirsty roots crowding the streams as we travel near Hamilton.
These pictures and memories I treasure.  Louise Bronstad

 <blockquote class="Cb2"><img class="mlr" src="../pic/Pinky/Walt-pinky.png" alt="picture Walt Bronstad">&nbsp;&nbsp;The housekeeper, Esther Schneider, is a surprise. My guess is that the onset of Ethel's diabetes limited her. Thus she needs help keeping the household running. Ethel, suffering untreated diabetes, may not have been up to bringing in wood each morning to get the wood-fired kitchen range going. Milking the cow, churning butter, bringing in water from the windmill tank - all required work, unfamiliar in contemorary kitchens.
<br><br> 
Seven years after this census date, Mother and I visited her parents; after wakeing and eating, she took me along to the barnyard, showing me the potatoe patch below the barnyard. Papa Walton found fertilizing the potatoes with cow manure a distasteful idea, but clearly potato plants closest to the barnyard flourished best. She showing me how to milk a cow, how to carefully keep barnyard trash from the cow's flank and udder, out of the pail whilst her exertions filled the pail with squirts of milk. Thence to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butter_churn" target="_blank">plunger-churn</a> where more effort separated butterfat in gathering yellow balls from the milk. Later we went to the woodpile; while I was not instructed in use of the axe lest I remove a toe; I could carry in an armfull of split wood for the kitchen wood box.
<br><br>
Their niece Vivian Embrey is less surprising; she was making her way in the world and found temporary, familial assistance on her journey several times in the early '40's.
<br><br>
Vivian's parents were Ethel's brother, <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/sources/KJC5-6JP" target="_blank">Ambrose R Embrey (52)</a>, and his wife, <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/sources/GWMK-ZL2" target="_blank">Nell Embrey (51)</a>.
