<mark>Will Walton's</mark> Father, was from an intermittent, patrilineal, line of Preacher&mdash;Farmers ( Barren, KY &lArr; Louisa, VA &lArr; Henrico, VA, British Colonial America &lArr; St. Peter's Parish, New Kent, VA, British Colonial America &lArr; Seaton, Devon, England, United Kingdom in 1628.).

"Merry Olde England" was not always so merry: <br>
"The King of England in 1630 was Charles I, who reigned from 1625 until his execution in 1649. He was the second son of James VI and I and faced significant challenges during his rule, including conflicts with Parliament and the English Civil War." &mdash;Wikipedia. 
<br><br>
 We can infer that, having gone to Oxford, Reverend William was one with The Church of England.

"From 1581, a new restriction on matriculation came into force. From that date all matriculating students over the age of 16 were required to declare their assent to the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England, the Book of Common Prayer and the oath of Royal Supremacy. In order to demonstrate this assent, the matriculating student swore the oath of supremacy and signed his name on pages bound up in a register with a copy of the Thirty-Nine Articles. This effectively barred anyone who was not a member of the Church of England from entering the University; students who were Roman Catholic, Jewish, Muslim or non-conformist protestants, for example, were now excluded." &mdash; https://blogs.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/archivesandmanuscripts/2023/10/13/on-the-roll-a-brief-history-of-matriculation/

William Claibourne Walton, son of William Asbury and Mariah Smith Walton, was born 8 April 1832 in Barren County, Kentucky. About 1865 in Kentucky, he married Williamina America "Ina" Wood. The family lived in Munfordville, Hart County, Kentucky in 1860, 1870, 1880. In 1890, the Walton family left Munfordville with six of their unmarried children and boarded the train for Abilene, Texas. When the found most of the terrritory was ranch land, they moved to Falls County where they raised one year's crop at Chilton before moving on the Blue Ridge place in Hamilton County. They had ten children of which nine were living in 1900.<br>
<br>Barrett and mate Suzie also left Kentucky and joined the family later. The children were Lilian, Cora, Frank and Nora. The older girls married Blackwells. Frank’s mate was Emma Perry and Nora married Ray V Davis. Buford and Lula Grubbs married and their child was Maud. Annie, already married in Kentucky brought her husband A B Craddock and children Susie, Elizabeth, Irene, George, Hattie, Grant, Agnes and Annie Buford to Hamilton, but soon return to their native state Kentucky. <br>
<br>Family members were active in both the Methodist and Baptist churches.

<p>Will Walton's Mother, <img class="mlr" src="../pic/Pinky/Ina(Wood)-pinky.png" alt="picture Ina(Wood)"> Williamina America Wood 
<a href="https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/L7JJ-GZP/williamina-america-wood-1842-1924" target="_blank"> [FS Data]</a><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i> was born 1842-07-24 in Metcalfe Co. Ky. She died 1924-01-19 and is buried in Hamilton Co,, TX.</p>

 <blockquote class="Cg1"><img class="mlr" src="../pic/Pinky/Walt-pinky.png" alt="picture Walt Bronstad">
<p>Will's Mother, Williamina America Wood, was of a line of Farmers (Metcalfe Co. Ky, &lArr; VA, British Colonial America.) Her father, Twyman Wood (1801 -1883), owned 6 slaves according to "United States Census (Slave Schedule, 1860). Her grandfather, William Johnson Wood owned 15 according to the same slave census. Earlier records for the Wood line are fewer, but clearly that line was in America in the early 18th century, if not sooner.
<br><br>
 
 &nbsp;It's discomforting to know that I descend from multiple lines of American slave holders. Much of the comforts and ease I and my predecessors knew came at the expense of unwilling, compelled men, women and children of dark skin, and their enslaved descendants.<br><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;Afro Americans labored for the wealth my ancestors accumulated, but few Blacks could accumulate much wealth beyond the skills they acquired. 
 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not simply to condemn my line, history has done much of that. A significant portion of the wealth, that in the form of owned humans, simply evaporated after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation" target="_blank"> The Emancipation Proclamation</a><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i> was enforced. The proclamation could not lift the burdens of racial misinformation and "otherness" that yet poison national harmony. And reparations are somehow in order, but that issue is a moral, political, economic and pragmatic quagmire.
 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;More daunting is the awareness that in future our present casual abuse of Mother Earth and the multitude of living forms who share Mother Earth with us, may reap punishment orders of magnitudes greater than the punishments of the American Civil War and mid 20<sup>th</sup> century desegregation. Just as my forefathers could ignore the moral and practical implications of their error with slavery, we today ignore the moral and practical implications of or errors with this world. Just as Washington and Jefferson bought and used slaves, we eat animals and burn petrochemicals. I find it blind hypocrisy to condemn the 19 <sup>th</sup> century Wood family while driving to McDonalds for a Big Mac.

Dr. Hicks died when I was only three years old, but I have very fond and vivid memories of him. No wonder, he always wore a three-piece suit and had a long white beard and mustache. He kept a pocket watch in his vest pocket which chimed. I would sit in his lap, listen to the watch, chime, and play with his beard. He was the first person that I ever knew who died. Because I was so young, the concept of dying was hard for me to understand, and I kept wanting him to come back and play with me. I loved staying with Aunt Ina. She had feather beds and I especially liked to stay with her in the winter when I could snuggle down in the feather bed and get all nice and warm. She would also heat bricks to put in our bed to warm the covers and to keep our feet warm.

There wasn’t a house there any longer, but they enjoyed seeing the place where it had been. Aunt Ina told a funny story that the old home place reminded her of. When she was a very small child it was the time when children were seen, but not heard. One Sunday her parents had the preacher over for dinner and fried chicken was on the menu. The children had all been sent to another room while the adults ate first, But Aunt Ina was peeking through the door. She saw the preacher about the spear, the chicken gizzard and she yelled out "Save the gizzard for me". I think she got into quite a lot of trouble because of the chicken gizzard. <br>

I was the very first person in our entire family to get the mumps. Mother and Daddy were intent on staying away from me so they wouldn’t get infected. I just stayed in my room and they brought in my food and then dashed right out. Papaw felt sorry for me and started staying in the room with me all time, keeping me company. Sure enough, he came down with the mumps and was very very sick. He would have been in his late 60s at that time.

I've found no clue why Grandfather did not continue with dentistry. One can point to his marriage to Ethel (Embrey) Price 17 December 1901. I believe he found more delight in watching his food crops and farm animals grow than in looking into the diseased mouths and fearful faces of patients on whom he may have to inflict pain.

<blockquote class="Cm2"><img class="mlr" src="../pic/Pinky/FlorenceAnnWalton-pinky.png" alt="picture Florence Ann Walton"> Claibourne Walton (uncle Cleburne) always called himself my favorite Walton uncle, as he was my only Walton uncle. He said I gave him his first lesson in parenting. I was three years older than Winston, so from my first three years, I was the only child in the immediate family and they all like to take me around and show me off. One morning, Claibourne took me to the grocery store in Moline, and the lady, Mrs. Murphy, who owned the store gave me some candy. Uncle Claibourne told me to thank Mrs. Murphy and I said “no“. Uncle Claibourne then told me that we would stay in the store until I told Mrs. Murphy thank you. later on in the afternoon, we finally left, but I had never told Mrs. Murphy thank you. Uncle Claibourne just finally gave up on me. He always said that I taught him to never give a child an ultimatum that you weren’t willing or able to stick to. When Winston came along I was delighted. I adored him, although I don’t think he remembers it exactly that way. One time we were out by ourselves playing in the stock tank. He could swim, I couldn’t, and he kept me from drowning after I walked off in deep water.

<p> An accident which resulted in the instant death of Frederick Walton the little five year old son of <mark>Mr. and Mrs. Will Walton</mark> of Blue Ridge, occurred Wednesday afternoon at about 3:30 o'clock near the residence of W. O. O'Bannon, four miles from Hamilton.
<br><br>
The little boy was riding in a wagon in which his uncle, Tom Walton, was hauling a hay press. The child was standing near the press, when an upright lever caught in a low telephone wire, toppling over the press. It is supposed the child jumped from the wagon, the press falling out of the wagon on him, crushing him to death instantly.--<u>Hamilton Herald</u>. </p>
<blockquote class="Cm2"><img class="mlr" src="../pic/Pinky/Walt-pinky.png" alt="picture Walt Bronstad">&nbsp;&nbsp; Grandfather <b>Will Walton</b> said of Frederick,"We knew Fred was uncommon, he was always pleased with whatever we gave him or did for him. We had expected great things of such a disposition, but now he is gone."<br><br>The pain of this loss struck not only parents, siblings, Aunts and Uncles; the pain has become part of the patrimony of the next generation. <br><br>

<blockquote class="Cr2"><h4>&nbsp;<img class="mlr" src="../pic/Pinky/Embrey-pinky.png" alt="picture Embrey Walton">&nbsp;W. E. WALTON FAMILY</h4>
[I spe]nt most of the first quarter, Twentieth century, in Hamilton County. I had diptheria during babyhood and Dr Jas [?] administered toxin-antitoxin; [?]dly the first used in the county. 
[?]v buildings erected on the square [?]e square paved by a huge horse-[powered] rock crusher. There were phonographs-and motorcycles before electric [lights and] indoor plumbing, telephones, w[indow] screens were commonplace. [fin]ally cars, then trucks, replaced bug[gies and h]acks, surreys and wagons; then gas [station]s and garages superseded livery [stables] and blacksmith shops. Roads were [improv]ed consistently.
<br><br>
[I was]thrilled by the first railroad from [Gates]ville: awed by dynamite blasts and [bridge]s as more tracks were constructed [between G]atesville and Comanche. Soon after [the las]t track was built, a big rain washed [out a s]mall bridge a few blocks north of the [Hamilt}on station. The first rail worker fatal[ity the] first car-train death in the county, I [?] happened within two miles of my [?]bd home.
<br><br>
Haley's comet was a familiar sight in [the night.] I wondered if I might see its next [appear]ance (due 1986). A one-day excur[sion to] Waco's Cotton Palace was exciting. [The fir]st airplane I saw was piloted by [?]n Stinson during a carnival picnic [?]ly. Circuses in the fall were interest[ing, fi]shing and hunting, when it was too cold for field work, play at school [ and so]metimes a family picnic, constituted [most o]f our recreation.
<br><br>
[Som]etimes from home, a few miles [north] east of Hamilton, a heavy pall of [smoke]from four cotton gins, two cotton [seed o]il mills, a compress, flour mill, etc. [gave th]e town an industrial appearance, or [warne]d us for an approaching "Blue Norther".
<br><br>
[We] were thrilled by music of visiting U.S. [Army] and plane training flights after war [was d]eclared, April 1917. We rejoiced in [the ar]mistice celebration in 1918 and then [were s]addened within the next few months by many flu deaths.
<br><br>
[In th]e fall of 1918 we could see light from [a bur]ning oil well near Desdemonia, [in Coma]nche County. Soon many giant [wood]en derricks sprang up in the county [?]e in oil searching - no concern for [?]en. The wonder of radio followed [quickly.]
<br><br>
[On] May 5, 1915, the tragic death of my [broth]er. Frederick, age five, distressed us [esp]ecially my parents. One consolation [was i]n the words of King David, "I cannot [bring] him back but can go to him". Little [thought] now that forty-two years later I would [lose th]e only son I had at that time, Embrey. [?]nd again be consoled as before plus [grant]ded assurance gained through years of Bible study.
<br><br>
[Aft]er fifty-two years in Fort Worth, Hamil[ton is still "Home". My parents were Wm and Ethel Walton. My first wife and I had three children, Janetha. Embry. Jr. and Nan. Alter my tirst wife's death I married Beulah and we have Emily and Paul. All five have enviable records of which I am very proud. I also have four grandchildren and [?]great-grandchildren. I have four sisters, Aubrey, Annie, Louise, and Ina. W. E. Walton.

<p> <b>W. T. Walton</b>, one of Hamiltor county's best citizens and a prosperous farmer, was a pleasant business caller in the Herald-Record office last Saturday afternoon. While here he informed us that his daughter, <a href="Walton_Annie_Joy_Walton.html" target="_blank"> Miss Annie Walton</a> had returned to John Tarleton College in Stephenville for her last year in that institution. <a href="Walton_Aubrey_Gilkes.html" target="_blank"> Miss Aubrey Walton</a>, who graduated from Tarleton last spring, will teach with her brother, <a href="Walton_William_E.html" target="_blank"> Prof. Embrey Walton</a>, in the Shive school this year. This family of young folks are ambitious and are attaining to great usefulness in their school work, and a legion of friends wish for their continued success and happiness.</p>

<blockquote class="Cm2"><img class="mlr" src="../pic/Pinky/Walt-pinky.png" alt="picture Walt Bronstad">&nbsp;&nbsp; I get the impression of a man who was "bustin his buttons" with Fatherly pride. Wouldn't suffice to simply talk up his children to the fellows on the Hamilton courthouse square, or congenial congregants of his church. Nothing less than the entire literati in the reach of the <u>Hamilton Herald</u> would do. <br><br>
And it was quite an achievement for each sibling; homework hours were sandwiched between farm chores and the limited availability of kerosene lamps and oil for night reading light.<br><br>
And it was an achievement for <mark>Will and Ethell</mark> who could manage to send each child to school and continue to run the farm with a declining family work force.

It's an undulating section of land, covered in grass and live oak trees. At the 'top' of the section were rude shelter and feeder troughs. 
<br><br>
WIll would feed the cattle frequently throughout the week; that let him check on his cattle, to see if any were injured or in calf and other such work of stockmen. The road hugged the fencelines, wherever terrain and live oak clusters permitted, so as to ease the job of checking and fixing the fences. 
<br><br>
But that day, Mother crept slower than usual along the rough rutted road, seeking Claibourne's shack. It took Claibourne long, isolated nights of wrestling with his soul before he could find a way to meet Leone's demand to change to her family's church.
<br><br>
At the time, I inferred Claibourne had built a retreat shack, but after having read Grace (Embrey) Eubanks account of James Monroe Embreys settling near Hamilton, " Later there were other small houses done on the ranch near Bear Creek--moving closer to town each time they were built", I now infer Claibourne squatted in an abandoned house/shack.
<br><br>
Regardless of the theological choices consequences on Claibourne's soul, it's a damned good thing Claibourne made the choice he did for the sake of Winston and Cynthia Dawn Walton.

 <h4>The Walton‘s family garden scarecrow.</h4>
 
Big Whitey had hardly crowded his shrill “cock-a-doodle-doo“ from that stout leghorn neck when <mark>William Twyman Walton</mark> opened his big blue eyes and bounded to the floor, exclaiming "Gosh-o-landin', Ethel, like brother Barret would say, I should have been up an hour ago.
<br><br>
One of Will's chief delights was to relate a humorous incident or one that evoked pleasure. So he smiled to himself as he anticipated the day's plowing, while lighting the kindling and wood in the cook stove as he listened intermittently to the "potrack" of the guineas and gobble of the turkeys, hoping that some noise from Ethel, Embrey, Aubrey, Annie Joy, Louise, or Ina would announce other awakenings.
<br><br>
He reminisced about the cattle drives that he and other cowboys made to Kansas market a few years ago.
<br><br>
While filling the kettle with water for oatmeal, he proceeded to grind fresh coffee beans in the grinder that was attached to the wall. During this time, he continued to drop just as many pans and pots as possible to arouse the family. When these clatters failed to awake anyone except Ethel, he recited in his unmistakable loud tenor voice, the little Irish poem;
<ul style="list-style-type:none;" class="cursive">
<li>Jackie and Jennie </li>
<li>they lived in the rye,</li>
<li>They had a little baby </li>
<li>with one black eye.</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>"Jennie", said Jackie, </li>
<li>"let's knock it in the head."</li>
<li>"No Jackie," said Jennie, </li>
<li>"let's buy it some bread.</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>You buy it one loaf</li>
<li>and I'll buy it two. </li>
<li>We'll bring up our children </li>
<li>like other folks do."</li>
</ul>
<br>
Poems pleased the children. Hearing Papa sing or recite poetry early in the morning meant that he had not been lately too upset by some unpleasant incident, as a pole cat absconding under the back porch, or some similar happening.
<br><br>
When the usual chores such as lunch fixing were completed, the four older children loaded into the surrey. The son, Embrey, who was the oldest, was in the driver's seat, with his feet braced tight against the buckboard. Will gave him the usual admonition to "look after the girls" as Old Mark, the faithful old buggy horse scurried down the lane past the O'Bannons', Brother Tom Walton's, the Stuckeys' and Browns' on the way to school.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Ethel finished pounding the dasher in the wooden churn for fresh butter and remarked to Ina, the youngest daughter, that today they would take a broom and some old clothes out to the upper garden to make a scarecrow. This would frighten those pesky birds from the English peas, lettuce, and radishes. Tar Baby, Ina's black puppy, tagged along behind Ethel and Ina as they dressed up the old broom into a staunch and distinctive scarecrow.
<br><br>
Will hitched his mule team of Beck and Moodin to the nearest fencepost when he drove into view of the grotesque figure standing there, and armed with his horse-whip, decided to investigate. Imagine the jovial occasion his discovery afforded!

<h2>ETHEL AND WILL WALTON FAMILY</H2>
Two boys and four girls were born to Ethel and Will Walton, married in 1901. Of five survivors, I am the third daughter. Those early years on a farm find many of my memories pastoral related.
<br><br>
I recall walking two miles to Blue Ridge School through fragrant pastures in spring past blazing sumacs or yellow-green broomweeds in their final fling in fall, and stopping once to skate on Grisham's tank in winter. With the icy wind at our backs, we stepped on the tiny, brittle, lacy, ice covered roadside pools to hear the tinkling sound. Later we attended East Ward and high school in town, riding in a buggy or surrey with hot bricks at our feet in winter.<br><br>
Much deference was given academic achievement and hard work; rarely did the latter preclude school attendance. The thrust of our purpose was adherence to spiritual values. Music was important.<br><br>
Some happiest times were singing around the piano. My father said every man should sing at his work, and truly my parents said their frustrations, exultations, joys, and faith in songs.<br><br><hr>
My first husband lost his life accidentally shortly after our son, Bobby, was born. We moved to Cranfills Gap in 1934. The road there from Hamilton, which we often made, was dusty and crooked. Once, Bobby, then four, getting out of the car to investigate a signal of trouble, and anticipating mechanical opportunities, clapped his hands and jubilantly cried,<br><br>"O Boy, look, Mommy, a flat!"
<br><br>
Clyde and I were married while he was in the grocery business and I was teaching.
Our two children were born at Cranfills Gap.<br><br>
Bobby was attending Texas Wesleyan College when we moved lo Fort Worth. After finishing, he worked as a tool designer, going later to Wisconsin. There he married Charlotte Munger; they have three children, Terri, Rex, and Mark. He is working for American Can.
<br><br>
Walton attended the Universities of Texas and Michigan. He lives in Austin with his wife, nee Pat Bird, his son, Matthew, and twin daughters, Kate and Kris.
<br><br>
Bette spends her extra time and cash traveling; she is getting another degree in Engineering.
<br><br>
Clyde, now eighty, still embellishes his fascinating stories of early life of Hamilton and Bosque counties
<br><br>
We still walk over grasslands where my grandfather J. M. Embrey, nearly a century ago had hundreds of sheep west of Hamilton.
<br><br>
The creek still runs part time that cooled my mother's feet and furnished mud to relieve her bee stings as she helped her father. Depressions remain where massive rocks were removed to build structures in town. Recently we found a fossil gastropod under a massive oak where my mother had played.
<br><br>
We still see the wild flowers coloring the pastures. The blue bells, winecups, Indian blankets, and paint brushes are still there.
We see the cedars clutching the hillsides, the oak clusters cleared goat-high, the willows with thirsty roots crowding the streams as we travel near Hamilton.
These pictures and memories I treasure. Louise Bronstad

 <blockquote class="Cb2"><img class="mlr" src="../pic/Pinky/Walt-pinky.png" alt="picture Walt Bronstad">&nbsp;&nbsp;The housekeeper, Esther Schneider, is a surprise. My guess is that the onset of Ethel's diabetes limited her. Thus she needs help keeping the household running. Ethel, suffering untreated diabetes, may not have been up to bringing in wood each morning to get the wood-fired kitchen range going. Milking the cow, churning butter, bringing in water from the windmill tank - all required work, unfamiliar in contemorary kitchens.
<br><br> 
Seven years after this census date, Mother and I visited her parents; after wakeing and eating, she took me along to the barnyard, showing me the potatoe patch below the barnyard. Papa Walton found fertilizing the potatoes with cow manure a distasteful idea, but clearly potato plants closest to the barnyard flourished best. She showing me how to milk a cow, how to carefully keep barnyard trash from the cow's flank and udder, out of the pail whilst her exertions filled the pail with squirts of milk. Thence to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butter_churn" target="_blank">plunger-churn</a><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i> where more effort separated butterfat in gathering yellow balls from the milk. Later we went to the woodpile; while I was not instructed in use of the axe lest I remove a toe; I could carry in an armfull of split wood for the kitchen wood box.
<br><br>
Their niece Vivian Embrey is less surprising; she was making her way in the world and found temporary, familial assistance on her journey several times in the early '40's.

<p><i>First cousins share one pair of grandparents</i>; <u>double cousins share four grandparents</u>. Having the same four grandparents in common, defines the relationship "double cousin".</p>
<hr>
<p>
Double cousins are not a rarity, at least not in the earlier Walton Family. Janetha June (Walton) Donohue notes in her work from the Pearl Webb Cemetery, Canmer, KY: "T. D. Walton is Thomas Dandridge Walton and he was a brother of Wm. C. Walton. His wife, Susan, was a sister to Wilhemina Wood." There were 8 surviving children in the Wm. C. and Wilhemina (Wood) Walton family; There were 4 surviving children in the <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/about/L41P-DDW" target="_blank">Thomas Dandridge Walton</a><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i> and <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/about/L41P-DX9" target="_blank">Susan Virginia Wood</a><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i> family, making for a set of 12 double cousins which included Will and James. The relationship appears to recede into the past like a fractal pattern. Almost certainly the double cousin relationship is older than written history.
