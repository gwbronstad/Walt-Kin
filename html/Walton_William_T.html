<blockquote class="faw"><sup class="footnote">[1]</sup>My great aunt, <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/details/KPS3-Y5L" target="_blank">Ina (Walton) Hicks</a> and <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/details/L7JV-4G4" target="_blank">Dr. Hicks</a> lived in Moline [TX.] and I loved to go visit them. Dr. Hicks died when I was only three years old, but I have very fond and vivid memories of him. No wonder, he always wore a three-piece suit and had a long white beard and mustache. He kept a pocket watch in his vest pocket which chimed. I would sit in his lap, listen to the watch, chime, and play with his beard. He was the first person that I ever knew who died. Because I was so young, the concept of dying was hard for me to understand, and I kept wanting him to come back and play with me. I loved staying with Aunt Ina. She had feather beds and I especially liked to stay with her in the winter when I could snuggle down in the feather bed and get all nice and warm. She would also heat bricks to put in our bed to warm the covers and to keep our feet warm.  <br>
In 1946, <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/details/LYG4-T1Q" target="_blank">Horace</A> and <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/details/LY7X-HGB" target="_blank">Robbie Walton</A> took Papaw [James Cross Walton] and Aunt Ina to Kentucky to visit all their nieces.  We also went out in the country, near Horse Cave, Kentucky. To visit the old [William Claiborne] Walton home place.  There wasn’t a house there any longer, but they enjoyed seeing the place where it had been. Aunt Ina told a funny story that the old home place reminded her of. When she was a very small child it was the time when children were seen, but not heard. One Sunday her parents had the preacher over for dinner and fried chicken was on the menu. The children had all been sent to another room while the adults ate first, But Aunt Ina was peeking through the door. She saw the preacher about the spear, the chicken gizzard and she yelled out “Save the gizzard for me“. I think she got into quite a lot of trouble because of the chicken gizzard.

Robbie summed it up best when she said “Papaw and Florence and don’t just love each other, it’s more like mutual adoration“. We spent many wonderful hours together, riding horses, singing together, going to cattle auctions, and him reading and telling me stories of the “good old” days. I was the very first person in our entire family to get the mumps. Mother and Daddy were intent on staying away from me so they wouldn’t get infected. I just stayed in my room and they brought in my food and then dashed right out. Papaw felt sorry for me and started staying in the room with me all time, keeping me company. Sure enough, he came down with the mumps and was very very sick. He would have been in his late 60s at that time.

<br>
    <p>Will Walton's parents were multi-generation Americans. </p><br>
    <p>Will's Father, was from an intermittent, patrilineal, line of Preacher--Farmers ( Barren, KY &lArr; Louisa, VA &lArr; Henrico, VA, British Colonial America &lArr;  St. Peter's Parish, New Kent, VA, British Colonial America &lArr;  Seaton, Devon, England, United Kingdom in 1628.).  The family of <a HREF="https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/about/L2QL-XFX " TARGET="_BLANK">Reverend William Walton</A> arrived in the year 1635 at Hingham, Massachusetts Bay Colony, British Colonial America. </p><br>

<p>Will's Mother, Williamina America Wood, was of a line of Farmers (Metcalfe Co. Ky,  &lArr; VA, British Colonial America.) Her father, Twyman Wood (1801 -1883), owned 6 slaves according to "United States Census (Slave Schedule, 1860).  Her grandfather, William Johnson Wood owned 15 according to the same slave census. Earlier records for the Wood line are fewer, but clearly that line was in America in the early 18th century, if not sooner.
<br><br>
 <BLOCKQUOTE CLASS="gwbt">&nbsp;&nbsp;It's discomforting to know that I descend from multiple lines of American slave holders. Much of the comforts and ease I and my predecessors knew came at the expense of unwilling, compelled men, women and children of dark skin, and their enslaved descendants.<br><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;Afro Americans labored for the wealth my ancestors accumulated, but few Blacks could accumulate much wealth beyond the skills they acquired.    
 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not simply to condemn my line, history has done much of that. A significant portion of the wealth, that in the form of owned humans, simply evaporated after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation" target="_blank">The Emancipation Proclamation</a> was enforced. The proclamation could not lift the burdens of racial misinformation and "otherness" that yet poison national harmony. And reparations are somehow in order, but that issue is a moral, political, economic and pragmatic quagmire.
  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;More daunting is the awareness that in future our present casual abuse of Mother Earth and the multitude of living forms who share Mother Earth with us, may reap punishment orders of magnitudes greater than the punishments of the American Civil War and mid 20<sup>th</sup> century desegregation. Just as my forefathers could ignore the moral and practical implications of their error with slavery, we today ignore the moral and practical implications of or errors with this world. Just as Washington and Jefferson bought and used slaves, we eat animals and burn petrochemicals. I find it blind hypocrisy to condemn the 19 <sup>th</sup> century Wood family while driving to McDonalds for a Big Mac.</blockquote><br>

<h4>1899&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Vanderbilt 1923 Alumni Directory </h4>
<p> William Twyman Walton of Texas attended the Dental School 1899-1900. </p>
<blockquote class="gwb"> Mother told me her Father, <b>W. T. Walton</b>, was interested in dentistry; he even had some teeth for study in his storage chest. A librarian at Vanderbilt University confirmed that <b>Will Walton</b> attended the Dental School 1899-1900. <br><br>
I've found no clue why Grandfather did not continue with dentistry. One can point to his marriage to Ethel (Embrey) Price 17 December 1901. I believe he found more delight in watching his food crops and farm animals grow than in looking into the diseased mouths and fearful faces of patients on whom he may have to inflict pain.

<h4><a id="FredDeath">&nbsp;</a>1915-05-14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Child [Frederick Walton] Meets Tragic Death </h4>
<p> An accident which resulted in the instant death of Frederick Walton the little five year old son of Mr. and Mrs. <b>Will Walton</b> of Blue Ridge, occurred Wednesday afternoon at about 3:30 o'clock near the residence of W. O. O'Bannon, four miles from Hamilton.
<br><br>
The little boy was riding in a wagon in which his uncle, Tom Walton, was hauling a hay press. The child was standing near the press, when an upright lever caught in a low telephone wire, toppling over the press. It is supposed the child jumped from the wagon, the press falling out of the wagon on him, crushing him to death instantly.--<u>Hamilton Herald</u>. </p>
<blockquote class="gwb">Grandfather <b>Will Walton</b> said of Frederick,"We knew Fred was uncommon, he was always pleased with whatever we gave him or did for him. We had expected great things of such a disposition, but now he is gone."<br><br>The pain of this loss struck not only parents, siblings, Aunts and Uncles; the pain has become part of the patrimony of the next generation. <br><br>
Mother took care that I, as a child, then later as an adult visited <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/19979160/frederick-cook-walton" target="_blank">Uncle Frederick's grave</a>. (You can visit too, vicariously, by clicking the link.)

<h4>1924-10-03&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <b><u>Hamilton Herald-Record</b></u></h4>
<p> <b>W. T. Walton</b>, one of Hamiltor county's best citizens and a prosperous farmer, was a pleasant business caller in the Herald-Record office last Saturday afternoon. While here he informed us that his daughter, <a href="Walton_Annie_Joy_Walton.html" target="_blank">Miss Annie Walton</a> had returned to John Tarleton College in Stephenville for her last year in that institution. <a href="Walton_Aubrey_Gilkes.html" target="_blank">Miss Aubrey Walton</a>, who graduated from Tarleton last spring, will teach with her brother, <a href="Walton_William_E.html" target="_blank">Prof. Embrey Walton</a>, in the Shive school this year. This family of young folks are ambitious and are attaining to great usefulness in their school work, and a legion of friends wish for their continued success and happiness.</p>

<blockquote class="gwb">I get the impression of a man who was "bustin his buttons" with Fatherly pride. Wouldn't suffice to simply talk up his children to the fellows on the Hamilton courthouse square, or congenial congregants of his church. Nothing less than the entire literati in the reach of the <u>Hamilton Herald</u> would do. <br><br>
And it was quite an achievement for each sibling; homework hours were sandwiched between farm chores and the limited availability of kerosene lamps and oil for night reading light.<br><br>
And it was an achievement for Will and Ethel who could manage to send each child to school and continue to run the farm with a declining family work force.

<p>Ethel Walton's youngest sister, <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/about/KJC5-LDJ" target="_blank">Great Aunt Grace Embrey</a> (1899 - 1990) wed (16 June 1917)  <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/sources/LX9W-9Q7" target="_blank">Leonard Aubrey Eubanks</a> (27 September 1897-22 October 1934, Breckenridge, Stephens, Texas)</p>
<p>L. A. Eubanks was chief Engineer of Brooks Gasoline Plant, he died of heart exhaustion, pneumonia + toxemia from accidental burns covering 1/3 of his body.</P>

<p>A desperate Grace had children ages 4, 8, 10, 13, 14 and 15. Some (all?) of them were routed among relatives for care and sustenance. These children were Ethyl Walton's nieces and nephews. <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/sources/GY4T-V2L" target="_blank">Anetha Jean Eubank</a>, the 13 year old, whom we later knew as Dink told us she and the other children hated it when it was time to live with Will and Ethyl. Ethyl was an awful cook and <b>Will Walton</b> a stern disciplinarian; they had to eat all their food before they could leave the table.</P>

<blockquote class="gwb">Some families migrated westward as near family units. Most of the family of my Great Grandfather Bronstad from Hedemarken, Norway eventually came, in 3 or more traveling groups, to the Norwegian area of Bosque County, TX. Most of Claiborne Walton's children came with him from Kentucky to Hamilton County, TX. Some of James Monroe Cameron's brothers come from Tippah, Mississippi to join him in Hamilton, Texas. <br><br>In familial union, more could be done; in times of crisis, help was at hand, children were cared for. <br><br>

<blockquote class="gwb">The housekeeper, Esther Schneider, is a surprise. My guess is that the onset of Ethel's diabetes limited her. Thus she needs help keeping the household running. Ethel, suffering untreated diabetes, may not have been up to bringing in wood each morning to get the wood-fired kitchen range going. Milking the cow, churning butter, bringing in water from the windmill tank - all required work, unfamiliar in contemorary kitchens.
<br><br> 
Seven years after this census date, Mother and I visited her parents; after wakeing and eating, she took me along to the barnyard, showing me the potatoe patch below the barnyard. Papa Walton found fertilizing the potatoes with cow manure a distasteful idea, but clearly potato plants closest to the barnyard flourished best. She showing me how to milk a cow, how to carefully keep barnyard trash from the cow's flank and udder, out of the pail whilst her exertions filled the pail with squirts of milk. Thence to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butter_churn" target="_blank">plunger-churn</a> where more effort separated butterfat in gathering yellow balls from the milk. Later we went to the woodpile; while I was not instructed in use of the axe lest I remove a toe; I could carry in an armfull of split wood for the kitchen wood box.
<br><br>
Their niece Vivian Embrey is less surprising; she was making her way in the world and found temporary, familial assistance on her journey several times in the early '40's.

Both Louise Bronstad and Horace Grant Walton share not one grandfather, like first cousins, but two (<a href="https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/details/LCQZ-D79" target="_blank">William Claiborne Walton</a> and <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/details/KJCT-CYJ" target="_blank">James Monroe Embrey</a>.)
