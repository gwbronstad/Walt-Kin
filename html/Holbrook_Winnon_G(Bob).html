   <div class="grid-item">
   <h4>1948-12-24</h4>
   <p>Some of the 11th and 12th grade boys went rabbit hunting Friday night.. We got six of the fattest rabbits you ever saw. It looks like rabbit hunting will be good this season. The following went on the big hunt; Graham McNamie Phillips, Paul B. Rohne Jr., Arlen Rhone and Bobby Holbrook</p>
<blockquote class="gwb">
I went too, and remember it well. <br><br>
The star of the evening was Bernadine, Bob's first true mechanical love. Late summer of '47, Bob and Clyde had gone with a local harvest crew, harvesting grain up the midwest. Bob's hard earned money burnt a hole in his pocket. A local farmer had given up on his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Model_A_(1927%E2%80%931931)" target="_blank">Ford Model A sedan</a> and was letting it go for an amount within Bob's budget. It was within Bob's budget because it had all but forgotten how to run, and would require a lot of care and repair to return to a runnable state.<br><br>
First and foremost, this was simply not a young man's car. Bob really wanted a convertible. Putting his Cranfills Gap High School shop class skill to work, Bob simply cut the top off, leaving the windscreen and wiper mechanism intact. While the conversion still did not look like a young man's car, it did look like almost nothing else.
<br><br>
The summer of '48, Bob worked for Grady Cranfill in Grady's garage. Grady let Bob use tools and equipment to restore Bernadine to runability. No doubt Grady shared a lot of advice. After all, it was to be Bob's means of getting back and forth from the Gap to Clifton Lutheran Junior College, 18 miles away when he went to College, next year.
<br><br>
Grady let Bob make his own mistakes, too. Bob was sure the rear axle ring gear should be relocated to the opposite side of the gear case to even out mechanical wear. Sure enough, once everything was reassembled, it worked. The only problem was Bernadine now had three reverse gears and one forward gear. Bob was entirely sure he could drive the 18 miles to and from Clifton 60 miles an hour backwards, but Mother would not hear of it, fifteen years prior she lost a husband to a vehicular accident.
<br><br>
Bob loved showing Bernadine off. Friends and family got demonstration, often dangerous, rides. Bob and friends built a heavy sledge of 2 x 6 runners and planks during an unusual snow. Bernadine then pulled any and all through and around Cranfills gap. No fatalities reported and great fun had by most.   
<br><br>
In warmer weather, Bob taught me to drive Bernadine on Cranfills Gap's school yard. <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=spark+advance+lever+Model+A&t=newext&atb=v392-1&iax=videos&ia=videos&iai=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dv2ViOXhPNfs" TARGET="_BLANK">Two crucial controls were mounted behind the steering wheel</a>. You must retard the spark before cranking Bernadine.  Once the engine runs smothly, advance the spark to get more power. The other control was the throttle. 
<br><br>
To this day it surprises me that Mother even permitted Bob to go out at night: four adolescent boys with guns, driving across an unfamiliar pasture chasing jack rabbits and shooting at them. What could go wrong? That I was permitted to go is even more astonishing, but to me it was great fun. A nighttime safari hunting the pernicious, pasture trashing jack rabbit.
<br><br>
Bernadine performed flawlessly.
</blockquote>

<h4>1949-04-22</h4>
<p>Heard the boys did right well for themselves in track at Clifton last week. Holbrook gathered up two blue ribbons, one in discuss (109 ft.) and broad jumped 19 ft. but lost the high jump after they put the pole on 5 ft 9 . . .

</p>

<h4>1951-09-21</h4>
<p>Bobby Holbrook left Sunday for Fort Worth where he enrolled as a student in Texas Wesleyan College.
</p>

<h4>1952-10-31</h4>
<p>Bobby Holbrook, son of Mr. and Mrs. C. P. Bronstad of 5011 Parish Road, Fort Worth, was selected by the Guardians of the Golden Shears committee to be the second wearer of the award for the fall semester at Texas Wesleyan College.
<br><br>
He is a senior social science major with a minor in religion. He lives in Mulkey Hall and is the second floor assistant.
<br><br>
Holbrook was graduated from Cranfills Gap High school in the spring of 1949 and entered Clifton Junior College at Clifton, that fall. While at Clifton, he was a member of the college choir for two years. In his sophomore year, he was chosen as manager of this choir. He also served as president of the Emersonian Literary Society, and was later chosen to be a member of Phi Theta Kappa honorary society.
<br><br>
Upon graduating from Clifton Junior College, Bobby entered Texas Wesleyan. He immediately became active in extra-curricular activities and campus organization. He is a member of Wesleyan Singers, Methodist Student Movement, and the senior class.
<br><br>
His selection last May as senior class president is another evidence of his leadership and outstanding work. Genuinely interested in his fellow students, Bobby is a typical TWite with his friendly greeting and all-around personality.
<br><br>
It is a real pleasure to be associated with such an outstanding student. His integrity and sincerity in campus affairs is genuinely appreciated. Congratulations to another of the "outstanding" at TWC.
