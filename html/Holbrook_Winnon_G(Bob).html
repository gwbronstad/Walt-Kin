   <h2>The Great Depression flails downward, gravitationally drawn to economic bedrock; a young widow with toddler (Bob) finds a job closer to her parent's home.</h2>
   <hr>
   <h3> The Clifton Record (a Bosque County, Texas weekly newspaper) recorded the comings and goings in quiet neighboring areas like Cranfills Gap; all the better to increase readership beyond Clifton, TX. I mined microfilm of the Clifton Record for family references. I saw slimmest images of Louise and Bob's coming into the social awareness of the Gap, much as one might see, passing a wooden fence, a kinetoscopic view of a neighbor's back yard. Slim little images of their past like:  </h3>
<h4>1934-09-21</h4>
<p>The Cranfills Gap High School had its formal opening last Monday morning. The devotional exercises were led by Rev. Farmer. Interesting and constructive talks were given by the following: Rev. J. A. Urnes, Mrs. Clara French Richards, Prof. E. B. Harris and Prof. E. P. Christensen. Miss Lurline Linn of Clifton rendered piano solo. The teachers for the school term just opened are as follows: Prof. Chauncy Ford, superintendent; Prof. Thilman Rogstad, coach; Mrs. E. B. Harris, English Mr. Charles Romine, principal of the grammar grades; Mr. Oran Knudson, Mrs. <b>Louise Holbrook</b> and Miss Johnnie Broyles, teachers in the grammar grades. . .</p>

<blockquote class="gwb"> The first Clifton Record mention of Mother is in conjunction with 'Brother Farmer' whom I knew only in Mother's frequent references to him. Put simply, the demands of propriety for a young widow and school teacher were met by boarding with the Methodist minister and his wife.<br>
<br>Bob, who would have been age 2 at this time, remembered Brother Farmer; likely reliable memories happened at a later age. </blockquote>

<h4>1935-02-01</h4>
<p>The Sociology, Home Economics and Civics classes are going to Dallas and Fort Worth this week-end. They are planning to visit several factories and plants, and will be special guests of the Ford Motor Company in Dallas Saturday. Mr. and Mrs. Ford, Mrs. Harris, Mr. Knudson, Miss Broyles and <b>Mrs. Holbrook</b> are the teachers who are going. We are taking both buses for transportation.</p>
<blockquote class="gwb">This is a rural school, busing is important to bring school children from miles around in all directions; in 1935 Cranfills Gap made do with two buses. There is no clue of how Louise dealt with 2 year old Bob. Likely she found a nurse in the Gap or left him with Ethel and Will Walton in Hamilton.</blockquote>

<h4>1935-02-22</h4>
<p>Miss Broyles’ room had a Valentine party last Thursday afternoon together with <b>Mrs. Holbrook</b>’s room The visitors were <b>Bobby Holbrook</b> and Ray Miller.
</p>
<h4>1935-05-03</h4>
<p><b>Mrs. Holbrook</b>’s and Miss Broyle’s pupils went on an Easter egg hunt the Thursday before Easter. There were also three visitors: <b>Bobby Holbrook</b>, Beverly Harris and Fred Finstad . . . 
</p>
<h4>1935-08-23</h4>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Binous Tindall, Rev. and Mrs. J. D. Farmer and family, Mrs. <b>Louise Holbrook</b> and son, <b>Bobby</b> and Mr. <b><a href="Bronstad_Clyde_P.html" target="_blank">Clyde Bronstad</a></b> are fishing on the Llano River this week. . . . 
</p>
<blockquote class="gwb">So it seems my Father is courting my Mother; Mother has multiple chaperones along to insure every appearance of propriety. After all, she could not bring the river to the parsonage. This event may be the one recorded in a photograph of <a href="0P-ClydeBPics.html#ClydeLouiseandBobby" target="_blank">Clyde, Louise and <b>Bobby</b>.</a> Or it may be the similar event a year later.<br><br>
Mr. and Mrs. Binous Tindall became lifelong family friends. Both Binous and Myrle were pillars of the Cranfills Gap Methodist Church.</blockquote>
<h4>1936-01-24</h4>
<p>
</p>The Home Economics girls began studying Child Care last week. On the days that we are supposed to have laboratory lessons, we observe children from two to five years old. We study their reactions to certain conditions. We have toys for them to play with; serve them cocoa, and teach them to play group and finger games. The children we observed last week were <b>Bobby Holbrook</b>, Marivone Windham, Mary Nell Rohne, Patsy Lou Grimland and Billie Dunn. . . . 
</p>
<blockquote class="gwb">
Bobby is getting a lot of exposure to school settings; that may have helped him develop the exceptional social skills he demonstrated later in life. Louise was lucky that the little rural school district would permit the 3 year old in school. <br>I'm sure Mrs Farmer could not devote all her attention to <b>Bobby</b>; Mother must have found childcare a dificult problem.
</blockquote>
<h4>1936-08-14</h4>
<p>
Homer Bronstad has begun the erection of a new residence in the west part of town. He purchased the lot from Mrs. M. J. Mickelson</p><br>
<blockquote class="gwb">After World War II, Clyde's family lived for a couple of years in this house. This was after we lived in the Blum house and after Homer and family moved to Vernon TX.</a></blockquote>
<p> Mr. and Mrs. Binous Tindall, <b>Mr. and Mrs. Clyde Bronstad</b> and son and Rev. and Mrs. Farmer and son are on a fishing trip to the Llano River.

<h4>1938-07-15 </h4>
<p><b>Mr. and Mrs. Clyde Bronstad</b> and son, <b>Bobby</b>, have been vacationing and visiting in New Mexico during the past two weeks.
<blockquote class="gwb">Summer in Central Texas is brutal, Clyde's new home was too new to have tree shade. Two hard days drive to the West, lay the mountainous  climate of villages like Cloudcroft or the town of Ruidoso. Though the drive through West Texas and Eastern New Mexico could be hotter, comfort came with the far lower humidity and the cooling blast of lowered car windows rolling at 60 miles per hour down the highway. </blockquote>
<h4>1939-06-02</h4>
<p><b>Mrs. Clyde Bronstad</b> and son, <b>Bobby</b>, spent several days last week with <b>Mrs. Bronstad</b>’s mother, Mrs. Walton in Hamilton.

<blockquote class="wiki">
{From Wikipedia}<hr> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression" target="_blank">The Great Depression </a> was a severe global economic downturn from 1929 to 1939. The period was characterized by high rates of unemployment and poverty; drastic reductions in liquidity, industrial production, and trade; and widespread bank and business failures around the world. The economic contagion began in 1929 in the United States, the largest economy in the world, with the devastating Wall Street stock market crash of October 1929 often considered the beginning of the Depression. Among the countries with the most unemployed were the U.S., the United Kingdom, and Germany.
<br><br>
The Depression was preceded by a period of industrial growth and social development known as the "Roaring Twenties". Much of the profit generated by the boom was invested in speculation, such as on the stock market, which resulted in growing wealth inequality. Banks were subject to minimal regulation under laissez-faire economic policies, resulting in loose lending and widespread debt. By 1929, declining spending had led to reductions in manufacturing output and rising unemployment. Share values continued to rise until the Wall Street crash, after which the slide continued for three years, accompanied by a loss of confidence in the financial system. By 1933, the unemployment rate in the U.S. had risen to 25 percent, about one-third of farmers had lost their land, and about half of its 25,000 banks had gone out of business. The U.S. federal government under President Herbert Hoover was unwilling to intervene heavily in the economy. In the 1932 presidential election, Hoover was defeated by Franklin D. Roosevelt, who from 1933 pursued a set of expansive New Deal programs in order to provide relief and create jobs. In Germany, which depended heavily on U.S. loans, the crisis caused unemployment to rise to nearly 30% and fueled political extremism, paving the way for Adolf Hitler's Nazi Party to rise to power in 1933.
<br><br>
Between 1929 and 1932, worldwide gross domestic product (GDP) fell by an estimated 15%; in the U.S., the Depression resulted in a 30% contraction in GDP.[1] Recovery varied greatly around the world. Some economies, such as the U.S., Germany and Japan started to recover by the mid-1930s; others, like France, did not return to pre-shock growth rates until later in the decade.[2] The Depression had devastating economic effects on both wealthy and poor countries: all experienced drops in personal income, prices (deflation), tax revenues, and profits. International trade fell by more than 50%, and unemployment in some countries rose as high as 33%.[3] Cities around the world, especially those dependent on heavy industry, were heavily affected. Construction virtually halted in many countries, and farming communities and rural areas suffered as crop prices fell by up to 60%.[4][5][6] Faced with plummeting demand and few job alternatives, areas dependent on primary sector industries suffered the most.[7] The outbreak of World War II in 1939 ended the Depression, as it stimulated factory production, providing jobs for women as militaries absorbed large numbers of young, unemployed men.

<blockquote class="gwb">
In a community like Cranfills Gap, very little went unnoticed. There were no Gestapo or NKVD spies earning their State Security keep, but there were neighbors who wanted to know which kin visited whom and where their neighbors had been the last two days.<br><br>
Such information did not so much stabilize the state as sell the local weeklies, The <u>Clifton Record</u> or the <u>Meridian Tribune</u>. To me, <u>The Clifton Record</u> offered richer ore. There seemed to have been more Norwegian ties between Cranfills gap (the Gap) and Clifton than between the Gap and Meridian.<hr>
<br>
Other expressions of this web of social interest were less beneficial. Religious tension extended into Clyde's home and hobbled household harmony. Louise was a committed Methodist and Clyde was a formally Confirmed Lutheran. Clyde and Louise wed not in Cranfills Gap's St Olaf Lutheran Church, but in a Lutheran Church in Waco. Surely they agreed on mutual acceptance, but the difference continually hampered harmony. Conflicting issues were often decided on the battleground of scriptural quotations. <br><br>
Each, Clyde and Louise, retained their religious affiliation to the end of their lives. They were finally united in their joint graves.

<br><br>
War work has Clyde in a more urban locale; he will have investigated the cost of rental property to relocate his family.

<p>For a brief while, Clyde worked at the PX at the newly built Fort Hood near Kileen; as WW II preparations evolved, better applications for his skills emerged. </p>
<p>Context </p>
<blockquote class="wiki">
{From Wikipedia}<hr> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Cavazos" target="_blank">Fort Hood, now Fort Cavazos</a>, named in honor of Gen. Richard E. Cavazos, a native Texan and the US Army’s first Hispanic four-star general, was a military training facility during World War II, Its origin was the need for wide-open space to test and train with World War II tank destroyers. The War Department announced the location in January 1942, and the initial completion was set for that August.
<br><br>
During World War II, tank destroyers were developed to counter German mobile armored units. These were mobile anti-tank guns on armored halftracks or specially developed tanks. Wide-open space was needed for the tank destroyer testing and training, which Texas had in abundance. Andrew Davis (A.D.) Bruce was assigned to organize a new Tank Destroyer Tactical and Firing Center, and he chose Killeen, Texas for the new camp.[2] The War Department announced the selection on 15 January 1942. An initial acquisition of 180,000 acres (730 km2) was made, and it was estimated that the camp would cost $22.8 million for the land, facilities, and development of utilities. The date of completion was set for 15 August 1942.
<br><br>
About 300 families had to move from their homes to make room for the camp area and the communities of Clear Creek, Elijah, and Antelope were demolished to facilitate construction of the base. The old Sugar Loaf community, historically called the "Cradle of Killeen," provided the city with many of its first citizens in 1882. All that remains of the community is the mountain from which it took its name, located in the Fort Cavazos area. To lessen the burden of moving, the Army agreed to allow land to be used for grazing for a nominal grazing fee. This grazing arrangement still continues today.[citation needed]
<br><br>
In mid-August, the camp was occupied and the official opening took place on 18 September 1942. Camp Hood was named in February for the Confederate General John Bell Hood, who commanded Hood's Texas Brigade during the American Civil War,[3] part of a series of new training camps named for notable regional military leaders together with Camps Carson, Campbell and Atterbury.[4]
<br><br>
The original facilities provided housing and training sites for nearly 38,000 troops. In January 1943, an additional 16,000 acres (65 km2) in Bell County and 34,943 acres (141.41 km2) in Coryell County near Gatesville, Texas were purchased. The site near Gatesville was known as the sub-camp and later as North Camp Hood. During the war years, North Camp Hood housed nearly 40,000 troops and 4,000 prisoners of war, and was the site for the southern branch of the United States Disciplinary Barracks.[citation needed]
<br><br>
At the end of 1942, there were about 45,000 troops living and training at Camp Hood and in late June 1943 it peaked at almost 95,000 troops,[3] which was maintained until early 1944.

<p>In a deal that was consummated Tuesday of this week, Mr. E. A. Thompson of Hico sold his farm adjoining town to Mr. R. O. Blum, formerly being the Mrs. M. J. Mickelson place. </p>
<blockquote class=" gwb ">Clyde and family lived in the Blum house 1945–1947; it was wonderfully spacious, having more rooms than we could purpose. One or more upstairs rooms was locked, securing others' property, there was a sewing room in which very little was sewn.
<br><br>
In that house, I was first aware of being ill, spending nights on an Army surplus folding cot in the kitchen. Perhaps for warmth, perhaps for medicated steam. In that house, Bob suffered mumps in his adolescence: Dick and I were sternly warned to keep our distance, both to avoid disease and to avoid the wrath of an inexplicably testy Bob. In that house, new–born Bette came home as an infant, separating me from a Mother's attention.
<br><br>
In that house, for the better part of the summer, I owned Mother, all to my own, for Clyde and Bob were away in Kansas and states further North, earning money on wheat harvesting crew.
<br><br>
In that house, Mother taught me love of the pussy–willow catkins bulging day by day in spring warmth, until the slough of spring hail surrounded the house and shocked the pussy–willow into pause.
<br><br>
In that house, I now think, I witnessed a Mother making her nest for her new chick.

<h4><a id="Bernadine">1948-12-24</a></h4>
   
   <p>Some of the 11th and 12th grade boys went rabbit hunting Friday night.. We got six of the fattest rabbits you ever saw. It looks like rabbit hunting will be good this season. The following went on the big hunt; Graham McNamie Phillips, Paul B. Rohne Jr., Arlen Rhone and <b>Bobby</b> Holbrook</p>
<blockquote class="gwb">
I went too, and remember it well. <br><br>
The star of the evening was <a href="0P-BobHPics.html#BernadinePic" target="_blank">Bernadine</a>, Bob's first true mechanical love. Late summer of '47, Bob and Clyde had gone with a local harvest crew, harvesting grain up the midwest. Bob's hard earned money burnt a hole in his pocket. A local farmer had given up on his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Model_A_(1927%E2%80%931931)" target="_blank">Ford Model A sedan</a> and was letting it go for an amount within Bob's budget. It was within Bob's budget because it had all but forgotten how to run, and would require a lot of care and repair to return to a runnable state.<br><br>
First and foremost, this was simply not a young man's car. Bob really wanted a convertible. Putting his Cranfills Gap High School shop class skill to work, Bob simply cut the top off, leaving the windscreen and wiper mechanism intact. While the conversion still did not look like a young man's car, it did look like almost nothing else.
<br><br>
The summer of '48, Bob worked for Grady Cranfill in Grady's garage. Grady let Bob use tools and equipment to restore Bernadine to runability. No doubt Grady shared a lot of advice. After all, it was to be Bob's means of getting back and forth from the Gap to Clifton Lutheran Junior College, 18 miles away when he went to College, next year.
<br><br>
Grady let Bob make his own mistakes, too. Bob was sure the rear axle ring gear should be relocated to the opposite side of the gear case to even out mechanical wear. Sure enough, once everything was reassembled, it worked. The only problem was Bernadine now had three reverse gears and one forward gear. Bob was entirely sure he could drive the 18 miles to and from Clifton 60 miles an hour backwards, but Mother would not hear of it, fifteen years prior she lost a husband to a vehicular accident.
<br><br>
Bob loved showing Bernadine off. Friends and family got demonstration, often dangerous, rides. Bob and friends built a heavy sledge of 2 x 6 runners and planks during an unusual snow. Bernadine then pulled any and all through and around Cranfills gap. No fatalities reported and great fun had by most.   
<br><br>
In warmer weather, Bob taught me to drive Bernadine on Cranfills Gap's school yard. <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=spark+advance+lever+Model+A&t=newext&atb=v392-1&iax=videos&ia=videos&iai=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dv2ViOXhPNfs" TARGET="_BLANK">Two crucial controls were mounted behind the steering wheel</a>. You must retard the spark before cranking Bernadine.  Once the engine runs smothly, advance the spark to get more power. The other control was the throttle. 
<br><br>
To this day it surprises me that Mother even permitted Bob to go out that night: four adolescent boys with guns, driving across an unfamiliar pasture chasing jack rabbits and shooting at them from the car. What could go wrong? That I was permitted to go is even more astonishing, but to me it was great fun. A nighttime safari hunting the pernicious, pasture-plague the jack rabbit.
<br><br>
Bernadine performed perfectly.

<h4>1949-04-08</h4>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Clyde Bronstad and children, <b>Bobby</b>, Wally and Betty, were in Fort Worth Sunday visiting in the home of <b>Mrs. Bronstad</b>'s brother, Mr. W. E. Walton.
</p>
<h4>1949-04-22</h4>
<p>Heard the boys did right well for themselves in track at Clifton last week. Holbrook gathered up two blue ribbons, one in discuss (109 ft.) and broad jumped 19 ft. but lost the high jump after they put the pole on 5 ft 9 . . .

<h4>1949-04-22</h4>
<h4>Perry Suter Weds Miss Maurine Rohne</h4>
<p>St Olaf Lutheran Church, Cranfills Gap, was thronged with relatives and friends Saturday evening, September 10, at 6:00 o'clock for the marriage of Maurine, only daughter of Mr. and Mrs. P. B. Rohne, to Perry Suter, son of Mr. and Mrs. Norbert Suter. Lighted candles on the alter punctuated the twilight hour with fingers of light, forming a charming background for the double ring ceremony of profound beauty and simplicity, performed by the Rev. B. R. Maakestad, pastor of St. Olaf Lutheran Church.</p>
<p>The stately bride, who was given in marriage by her father, was daintily beautiful in a white slipper gown fashioned along princess lines with a deeply pointed lace yoke snugly fitted basque bodice, accented by a row of tiny satin covered buttons down the back. A satin period cap held in place her finger tipped bridal veil of white illusion. She carried a cascade bouquet of white rosebuds centered with a white orchid.</p>
<p>Miss Myrtle Mae Knudson of Meridian, maid of honor and the four bridesmaids, Miss Doris Jean Gloff of Clifton, Miss Mavis Gromatzky, of Hamilton , Miss Doris Bremer of Clifton and Mrs. Ivan Johnson of Cranfills Gap wore princess gowns of white organdy with dainty gloves and period caps to match. . . .</p>
<p>Kr. Ken Abbe of McGregor, best man and the four groomsmen, Arlen Rohne, Bobby Holbrook, Paul Rohne and Ivan Johnson, all of Cranfills Gap, were handsome in business suits and white carnation boutonnieres. . . .
</p>
<blockquote class= "gwb">Wayne Arlen Rohne,and  Bobby Holbrook were the best of friends. They went through High School and Junior College together. They kept in touch through the end of Bob's life.<br><br>
In the early 1980's Maurine Rohne taught my daughter at Zilker Elementary School in Austin, TX

<h4>1952-10-31</h4>
<p>Bobby Holbrook, son of Mr. and Mrs. C. P. Bronstad of 5011 Parish Road, Fort Worth, was selected by the Guardians of the Golden Shears committee to be the second wearer of the award for the fall semester at Texas Wesleyan College.
<br><br>
He is a senior social science major with a minor in religion. He lives in Mulkey Hall and is the second floor assistant.
<br><br>
Holbrook was graduated from Cranfills Gap High school in the spring of 1949 and entered Clifton Junior College at Clifton, that fall. While at Clifton, he was a member of the college choir for two years. In his sophomore year, he was chosen as manager of this choir. He also served as president of the Emersonian Literary Society, and was later chosen to be a member of Phi Theta Kappa honorary society.
<br><br>
Upon graduating from Clifton Junior College, <b>Bobby</b> entered Texas Wesleyan. He immediately became active in extra-curricular activities and campus organization. He is a member of Wesleyan Singers, Methodist Student Movement, and the senior class.
<br><br>
His selection last May as senior class president is another evidence of his leadership and outstanding work. Genuinely interested in his fellow students, <b>Bobby</b> is a typical TWite with his friendly greeting and all-around personality.
<br><br>
It is a real pleasure to be associated with such an outstanding student. His integrity and sincerity in campus affairs is genuinely appreciated. Congratulations to another of the "outstanding" at TWC.

<h2>Mark Holbrook on Bob Holbrook's "Dynamo"<a id="Dynamo"></a></h2> 
 <blockquote class="mwh">&nbsp;&nbsp;-From my notes he did this in 1980, at the house on Mason Street. From
the picture included here it looks like he did some of the work at a
friend's shop who had machining tools.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
He got the plans from <u>Mother Earth News</u>, and I'm pretty sure he was
interested in it for the engineering and mechanics involved, not for any
environmental reasons. The plans called for a car with a specific type
of manual transmission gear ratio, and the 1972 Chevy Vega was one of
the cars that qualified. The motor was an aircraft starter motor, and
the gas engine was a lawn mower engine. He had to custom-make mounting
hardware, dashboard controls and meters, and a rack to hold the 4
standard lead-acid car batteries in the back. The battery in the engine
compartment started the lawn mower engine. The accelerator pedal was
removed, and the little wheel to the left of the gear shift controlled
the gas engine speed.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Looking at the photo of the dash, some things I don't remember too well
- that was 44 years ago. There was a sequence of switches to throw in
order to start it up, and the electric motor had 2 speeds - 24 volts and
48 volts. I had to use the gear shift to control speed, and when I
needed to accelerate, I switched it to 48 volts. 24 volts was for
cruising and slow speeds. He had a charger that would charge it
overnight. One time I pulled out of the garage in a hurry and forgot to
unplug it, but the charger survived with just a few dents.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Top speed was 30 mph, and the range was about 2 miles, which was perfect
for me to drive it to school and back during my senior year. Most of the
time I made it back home fine, but sometimes I ran out of battery power
even with the gas engine running, but I would be able to get home just
by running the gas engine at a top speed of 5 mph. I got a lot of head
turns driving down the road at 30 mph with the sound of a lawn mower
engine!
<br>&nbsp;<br>
He christened the car "Dynamo" and had a personalized license plate
made, which I still have.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Dad wanted to show Dynamo to his buddies at work (probably American Can
Co. at that time) but since that was in Neenah, it was too far to drive
it there. He put it on a trailer and took it there, and for some reason
left it overnight. When he went back to work the next morning, he found
Dynamo with a rooster tied to the bumper. His buddies wanted it to be a
chicken hen to represent the start of a Rube Goldberg device but could
only get hold of a rooster. There's a photo of that somewhere but I
don't know where it is, if I find it I'll send it to you.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Later he ended up putting the gas engine back in the Vega, and I drove
it some more around 1985-1986, while he stored the electric parts in the
attic. They stayed in the attic at Capital drive until the house was
sold, and Rex probably knows what happened to them.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Dad later told me that Mother Earth News revised the plans with 8
batteries instead of 4.</blockquote>

<h2>Mark Holbrook on Bob Holbrook's Carbon Monoxide call<a id="Carbon Monoxide"></a></h2> 
 <blockquote class="mwh">
There’s the time Dad called the fire department because he had a headache. This was about 1985, and I happened to be there taking a nap after dinner. Mom anxiously woke me up saying “your Dad called the fire department, we have to go to Aunt Mary’s!” Dad rarely got headaches, and that particular night he remembered that carbon monoxide can cause a headache. This was before CO detectors were even available for the home. He called up the fire department and asked if they could come and check the house for carbon monoxide. Of course they would! Then he asked if they had to come with sirens blaring and they said “oh yes, we have to do that.” Mom knew she would be embarrassed by the whole situation, so Mom and I left in the car in the dark, passing the fire truck going the other way with sirens blaring, leaving Dad at home to face the fire department alone.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
They had him try an oxygen mask on to see if that would make him feel better, while neighbors had gathered outside to see what was going on. The CO test was negative, so while the crew packed up their gear, Dad headed out the back door and walked around front, asking the neighbors “Hey, what do you think is going on in there?"
