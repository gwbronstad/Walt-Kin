<H3><a name="0.C-9">CLARENCE  SYVERIN (ninth child)</a></H3>
Clarence Syverin, the sixth son and the ninth child, was born October 19, 1891, and grew up during the time of homemade sorghum and thick cream. He was baptized January 2, 1892, and the God-Parents were Mr. and Mrs. Evan Erickson, and the witnesses were Otto Bronstad and Syverine Bronstad. He was confirmed June 23, 1907. Clarence, like the others, attended the Harmony school, and was in the graduating class in 1912 at Clifton Lutheran College. For some time he was employed in the First National Bank in Clifton. Later he farmed for some time. He seemed to be the horseman of the bunch. He was named for Aunt Carrie Bronstad and Aunt Syverine Bronstad.
<P>Clarence was always strong and active. Once during threshing time, when the engineer let off some steam in my direction, he ran and jumped into my wagon just in time to grab the reins from me and subdue the team of Jack and Polly, and thus prevent a run-away scrape. But then one day while we were boys, he fell out of a live oak tree in our Samuelson pasture bending arm bones between the wrist and elbow of both arms. Our twin brothers got busy then: one riding to Norse to get Dr. 0. M. 01son, and the other riding to Hamilton County to summon Dad and Mother who were visiting friends there. And then there was that time during threshing time with the thresher at our place, when a bee sting made him a very sick man for a day or two, and unable to help with the grain hauling.</p>
<P>Clarence was married to Ethel Grace Barry in Waco, Texas, December 1, 1917 In 1918 he enlisted in the military service in World War I, and was stationed in the Air Force in Kelly Field, San Antonio, Texas. While he was there Grace lived in San Antonio. They were there on November 11, 1918 when the Armistice was announced, and the fighting ceased. That evening I
called on them, and we all &mdash; Clarence and Grace, another couple, and I &mdash; went to downtown San Antonio to help celebrate. That was the wildest crowd and celebration I ever witnessed and experienced.</p>
<P>After the war, Clarence and Grace went to Ranger, Texas, and there, in the oil boom days found employment doing several things, including trucking, and finally settled with the T & P Coal and Oil Company. He became the Superintendent in charge of a Gasoline Plant and Refinery at Caddo, Texas. This he followed until his retirement in 1953, when they came to Clifton and established themselves and still live at 1314 3rd. Street. Here he is a member of the Lions Club, and Grace is a member of the Magazine Club and the Civic Society.</p>
<P>Clarence and Grace have one daughter, 
<H4><a name="0.C-9.A">Martha Grace (grandchild)</a></H4>. <P>She was born in Ranger, Texas, November 27, 1923. She is a graduate of The Texas State College for Women, Denton, Texas. She was married to William Richard Robinson, March 29, 1943 at Reno, Nevada. Bill&mdash;as Mr. Robinson is called &mdash; was a career man in the military, and retired in 1960 with the rank of Major. While in the service, he had his family with him during a tour of duty in Austria. Since retirement, Bill has been employed by Arkla Gas Company, and the Robinsons reside at 1727 Elm St., Lawton, Oklahoma.</p>
<P>Bill and Martha have seven children as follows:</p>

<H3><a name="0.C-10"> ALVIN LAWRENCE (tenth child)</a></H3>
<P>I am Alvin Lawrence, the seventh son and the tenth child in the family. I was born March 18, 1894, and was reared during the time of J. Linn jewelry and kerosene lamps. I was baptized May 13, 1894. My God-Parents were Mr. and Mrs. L. P. Lund, and the witnesses were Carrie Bronstad and Anton Nelson. I was confirmed June 13, 1909, and I was named for Aunt Andrea and Uncle Lauris Nelson.
I attended the Harmony school and graduated from Clifton Lutheran College in 1914. I am a B. A. graduate of Luther College, Decorah, Iowa, and in 1933 I was graduated from The University of Texas with a M. A. degree. All the University study was done in summer sessions. At Luther College I was a baseball and basketball letterman.</p>
<P>With twelve children in the family, It was not unusual for some one to be sick or temporarily disabled. That happened to me one year on my first day at home from College. It was harvest time. Clarence was moving his binder from one field to another. He called to me to follow. I did &mdash; on Nell, a young filly, a bit frisky. Going home that evening, Nell was very restless and jittery, and I wondered how I would be able to mount. I finally tried it. My seat hit the saddle once, and by then Nell was high and I went rolling. I came up with a broken collar bone. That took care of the harvest work for me.</p>
<P>In September 1917, together with 94 other men from Bosque County, I entered the United States Army in World War I, and was stationed in Camp Travis, Texas. When the Armistice was signed and the war ended, I was a sergeant in the 54th Field Artillery, Battery D, 18th Division. I was discharged February 22. 1919. Immediately following discharge, I returned to Luther College and was graduated with the 1919 class.</p>
<P>I then entered the teaching profession as teacher and High School Principal in the Finley High School, Finley, North Dakota- Here I also served as Athletic Coach and Director, teaching Latin, history, and served as disciplinarian. Finley was the County Seat of Steele County. I spent one year in this school, found many fine and good people, enjoyed the year there, had wonderful experience in teaching, and in community life and leadership, in spite of the bitterly cold winter weather with temperatures going to 40 degrees below zero. The people were very good to me.</p>
<P>In 1920, I joined the faculty at Clifton Lutheran College. During about 19 years of service there, I taught several fields  &mdash;Latin, history, education and was Registrar during Junior College days. Also was athletic coach and director for several years, I resigned in 1939, and became the Office Manager with Clifton Mercantile Co.</p>
<P>On March 1, 1940, I became the Postmaster at Clifton. I was the first to serve as a Civil Service Postmaster in the Clifton office. I held this position uninterruptedly until Friday, September 13, 1963. On retiring I had a total of 25 years of government service to my credit. I am a member and Past - President of the Clifton Lions Club.</p>
<P>On July 20, 1920, I was married to Georgie Elnora Nelson, in Trinity Lutheran Church, Clifton. We had four children born to us. Bernice Noreen was born in Clifton, November 12, 1921. She died January 9, 1924. Vern Marion was born in Clifton, August 30, 1924. and died September 3, 1924. Virgie Onell was born in Waco, February 24, 1932, and died March 1, 1932. 
<H4><a name="0.C-10.C">Charles Odell (grandchild) </a></H4>was born in Waco, January 28, 1930.

<H3><a name="0.C-11">OLGA BELLE (eleventh child)</a></H3>
<P>Olga Belle, the fourth girl and the eleventh child in the family, was born September 6, 1896 and raised during the days of the Black widow spider and mother's transparent pie. She was named for Aunt Olivia Eggen and Aunt Jennie Belle Reesing. She was baptized on October 11, 1896. Her God-Parents were Mr. and Mrs. M. T. Anderson and the witnesses were Mr. and Mrs. S. J. Knudson. She was confirmed on June 18, 1911.</p>
<P>Belle attended the Harmony school, and was graduated from Clifton Lutheran College. Guess we all have close calls. Belle had at least two of them that we recall. One was the case of a black widow spider bite. She was a very sick girl. Another instance of distress in her life was when on a visit to a neighbor, she was accidentally struck in the head by a heavy, pointed article. There were hours of distress, concern, and anxiety while waiting for her to fight her way out of her difficulty. She did it.</p>
<P>On October 15, 1919, she was married to Johnnie Martin Huse, a graduate of Clifton Lutheran College, at our farm home, on a very rainy night  &mdash; so they tell me. </p>
<P>Beile and Johnnie had three children: Mary Belle, born in Clifton, August 30, 1920; John Martin Jr. was born in Clifton, April 6, 1925, and died January 4, 1937; Earl Christian, born in Waco, Texas, August 7, 1929.
Johnnie and Belle farmed in the Norse community for a number of years, after which they moved to Clifton, where they now reside at 102 North Avenue Q. During their time in Clifton, Johnnie has been employed with Clifton Mercantile Co., Texas Milling Co., Clifton Lutheran Sunset Home, and with his own Insurance business. For some years Belle was employed at the Clifton Lutheran Sunset Home as a nurse.</p>
<P>One of Belle's special interests is the piano. For some years she taught piano at home and at Cranfills Gap. She is the pianist of the family. While they lived on the farm, they were members of Our Savior's Lutheran Church, and during many of those years, Belle was the church organist. And for much of that time, Johnnie was the Sunday School Superintendent.</p>

C. Martin), and the name "Viola" was used because that was the name Dad wanted for her. She was baptized November 20, 1898. Her God-Parents were Mr. and Mrs. M. Sorenson and the witnesses were Torger Nelson and Beatrice Anderson. She was confirmed on June 8, 1913.</p>
<P>Vi is one who can say that she stepped on a rattler without any serious mishap. Coming in from cotton picking, the day was spent and darkness was coming on as we reached home. This snake was coiled just in front of the front steps, Vi stepped on it  &mdash; with bare feet probably;&mdash; and jumped to the porch floor in one leap as she heard the rattle. We killed the snake.</p>
<P>Viola too attended the Harmony school, and is a graduate of Clifton Lutheran College. She taught school as her first endeavor away from home, teaching the Meridian Creek school. After two years of teaching, she joined sister May and Miss Anna Grimland, enrolling as nurse students at the Baptist Hospital in Waco, Texas in 1920. She was graduated from this institution and became a Registered Nurse in 1923. She followed this profession throughout her active years.
