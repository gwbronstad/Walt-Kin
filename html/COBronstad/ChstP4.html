Clarence Syverin, the sixth son and the ninth child, was born October 19, 1891, and grew up during the time of homemade sorghum and thick cream. He was baptized January 2, 1892, and the God-Parents were Mr. and Mrs. Evan Erickson, and the witnesses were Otto Bronstad and Syverine Bronstad. He was confirmed June 23, 1907. Clarence, like the others, attended the Harmony school, and was in the graduating class in 1912 at Clifton Lutheran College. For some time he was employed in the First National Bank in Clifton. Later he farmed for some time. He seemed to be the horseman of the bunch. He was named for Aunt Carrie Bronstad and Aunt Syverine Bronstad.
<P>Clarence was always strong and active. Once during threshing time, when the engineer let off some steam in my direction, he ran and jumped into my wagon just in time to grab the reins from me and subdue the team of Jack and Polly, and thus prevent a run-away scrape. But then one day while we were boys, he fell out of a live oak tree in our Samuelson pasture bending arm bones between the wrist and elbow of both arms. Our twin brothers got busy then: one riding to Norse to get Dr. 0. M. 01son, and the other riding to Hamilton County to summon Dad and Mother who were visiting friends there. And then there was that time during threshing time with the thresher at our place, when a bee sting made him a very sick man for a day or two, and unable to help with the grain hauling.</p>
<P>Clarence was married to Ethel Grace Barry in Waco, Texas, December 1, 1917 In 1918 he enlisted in the military service in World War I, and was stationed in the Air Force in Kelly Field, San Antonio, Texas. While he was there Grace lived in San Antonio. They were there on November 11, 1918 when the Armistice was announced, and the fighting ceased. That evening I
called on them, and we all &mdash; Clarence and Grace, another couple, and I &mdash; went to downtown San Antonio to help celebrate. That was the wildest crowd and celebration I ever witnessed and experienced.</p>
<P>After the war, Clarence and Grace went to Ranger, Texas, and there, in the oil boom days found employment doing several things, including trucking, and finally settled with the T & P Coal and Oil Company. He became the Superintendent in charge of a Gasoline Plant and Refinery at Caddo, Texas. This he followed until his retirement in 1953, when they came to Clifton and established themselves and still live at 1314 3rd. Street. Here he is a member of the Lions Club, and Grace is a member of the Magazine Club and the Civic Society.</p>
<P>Clarence and Grace have one daughter, 
<H4><a name="O.C-9.A">Martha Grace (grandchild)</a></H4>. <P>She was born in Ranger, Texas, November 27, 1923. She is a graduate of The Texas State College for Women, Denton, Texas. She was married to William Richard Robinson, March 29, 1943 at Reno, Nevada. Bill&mdash;as Mr. Robinson is called &mdash; was a career man in the military, and retired in 1960 with the rank of Major. While in the service, he had his family with him during a tour of duty in Austria. Since retirement, Bill has been employed by Arkla Gas Company, and the Robinsons reside at 1727 Elm St., Lawton, Oklahoma.</p>
<P>Bill and Martha have seven children as follows:</p>
<H5><a name="O.C-9.A-1">1. Mary Grace (great-grandchild)</a></H5> was born in Ranger, Texas, August 16, 1946. She has a B. A. degree from Central State College, Edmond, Oklahoma. She was a teacher in the Oklahoma School system one year. She was married to Stanley Shelton, June 6, 1969, in Lawton, Oklahoma. Stanley is a Structural Engineer graduate of Oklahoma University, Norman, Okla., and is now an Army Lieutenant on active service in Europe.
<H5><a name="O.C-9.A-2">2. William James (great-grandchild)</a></H5> was born August 11, 1948, in Brecken-ridge, Texas, and is now a University student.
<H5><a name="O.C-9.A-3">3. Sandra Bronstad (great-grandchild)</a></H5>, was born October 13, 1949 in Milford, Connecticut. She was married in 1969 to David Holiday, and they have a daughter named Stacey. David and Sandra are both in college.
<H5>4. Elizabeth Ann (great-grandchild)</H5> was born in Salzburg, Austria, May 22, 1953.
<H5>5. Margaret Jane (great-grandchild)</H5> was born in Lawton, Oklahoma, June 8, 1956.
<H5>6. Martha Christina (great-grandchild)</H5>was born in Fort Smith, Arkansas, September 20, 1958.
<H5>7. Paul Barry (great-grandchild)</H5> was born September 24, 1961, in Lawton, Oklahoma
<H3><a name="O.C-10"><a href=" https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/details/L2Q9-RPY" target="_blank"><mark> ALVIN LAWRENCE (tenth child)</mark></a><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></H3>
<P>I am Alvin Lawrence, the seventh son and the tenth child in the family. I was born March 18, 1894, and was reared during the time of J. Linn jewelry and kerosene lamps. I was baptized May 13, 1894. My God-Parents were Mr. and Mrs. L. P. Lund, and the witnesses were Carrie Bronstad and Anton Nelson. I was confirmed June 13, 1909, and I was named for Aunt Andrea and Uncle Lauris Nelson.
I attended the Harmony school and graduated from Clifton Lutheran College in 1914. I am a B. A. graduate of Luther College, Decorah, Iowa, and in 1933 I was graduated from The University of Texas with a M. A. degree. All the University study was done in summer sessions. At Luther College I was a baseball and basketball letterman.</p>
<P>With twelve children in the family, It was not unusual for some one to be sick or temporarily disabled. That happened to me one year on my first day at home from College. It was harvest time. Clarence was moving his binder from one field to another. He called to me to follow. I did &mdash; on Nell, a young filly, a bit frisky. Going home that evening, Nell was very restless and jittery, and I wondered how I would be able to mount. I finally tried it. My seat hit the saddle once, and by then Nell was high and I went rolling. I came up with a broken collar bone. That took care of the harvest work for me.</p>
<P>In September 1917, together with 94 other men from Bosque County, I entered the United States Army in World War I, and was stationed in Camp Travis, Texas. When the Armistice was signed and the war ended, I was a sergeant in the 54th Field Artillery, Battery D, 18th Division. I was discharged February 22. 1919. Immediately following discharge, I returned to Luther College and was graduated with the 1919 class.</p>
<P>I then entered the teaching profession as teacher and High School Principal in the Finley High School, Finley, North Dakota- Here I also served as Athletic Coach and Director, teaching Latin, history, and served as disciplinarian. Finley was the County Seat of Steele County. I spent one year in this school, found many fine and good people, enjoyed the year there, had wonderful experience in teaching, and in community life and leadership, in spite of the bitterly cold winter weather with temperatures going to 40 degrees below zero. The people were very good to me.</p>
<P>In 1920, I joined the faculty at Clifton Lutheran College. During about 19 years of service there, I taught several fields  &mdash;Latin, history, education and was Registrar during Junior College days. Also was athletic coach and director for several years, I resigned in 1939, and became the Office Manager with Clifton Mercantile Co.</p>
<P>On March 1, 1940, I became the Postmaster at Clifton. I was the first to serve as a Civil Service Postmaster in the Clifton office. I held this position uninterruptedly until Friday, September 13, 1963. On retiring I had a total of 25 years of government service to my credit. I am a member and Past - President of the Clifton Lions Club.</p>
<P>On July 20, 1920, I was married to Georgie Elnora Nelson, in Trinity Lutheran Church, Clifton. We had four children born to us. Bernice Noreen was born in Clifton, November 12, 1921. She died January 9, 1924. Vern Marion was born in Clifton, August 30, 1924. and died September 3, 1924. Virgie Onell was born in Waco, February 24, 1932, and died March 1, 1932. 
<H4><a name="O.C-10.C">Charles Odell (grandchild) </a></H4>was born in Waco, January 28, 1930. Charles graduated from the Clifton schools  &mdash; the High School, and the Junior College, and graduated from North Texas State Teachers College with a B. S. degree in 1952. He was married to Mary Ann Anderson, August 16, 1952, in Clifton, and they have two daughters, both born in Beaumont, Texas; Susan Marie born October 18, 1957 and Cathey Lynn, born February 27, 1959. Charles and family reside at 6350 Carnation Drive, Beaumont, Texas 77706. Charles is Manager of Quotations with Ideco, a part of Drasser Industries. Georgie, my wife, died May 19, 1967.
<H3><a name="O.C-11"><a href=" https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/details/L2XG-RKT" target="_blank"><mark>OLGA BELLE (eleventh child)</mark></a><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></H3>
<P>Olga Belle, the fourth girl and the eleventh child in the family, was born September 6, 1896 and raised during the days of the Black widow spider and mother's transparent pie. She was named for Aunt Olivia Eggen and Aunt Jennie Belle Reesing. She was baptized on October 11, 1896. Her God-Parents were Mr. and Mrs. M. T. Anderson and the witnesses were Mr. and Mrs. S. J. Knudson. She was confirmed on June 18, 1911.</p>
<P>Belle attended the Harmony school, and was graduated from Clifton Lutheran College. Guess we all have close calls. Belle had at least two of them that we recall. One was the case of a black widow spider bite. She was a very sick girl. Another instance of distress in her life was when on a visit to a neighbor, she was accidentally struck in the head by a heavy, pointed article. There were hours of distress, concern, and anxiety while waiting for her to fight her way out of her difficulty. She did it.</p>
<P>On October 15, 1919, she was married to Johnnie Martin Huse, a graduate of Clifton Lutheran College, at our farm home, on a very rainy night  &mdash; so they tell me. </p>
<P>Beile and Johnnie had three children: Mary Belle, born in Clifton, August 30, 1920; John Martin Jr. was born in Clifton, April 6, 1925, and died January 4, 1937; Earl Christian, born in Waco, Texas, August 7, 1929.
Johnnie and Belle farmed in the Norse community for a number of years, after which they moved to Clifton, where they now reside at 102 North Avenue Q. During their time in Clifton, Johnnie has been employed with Clifton Mercantile Co., Texas Milling Co., Clifton Lutheran Sunset Home, and with his own Insurance business. For some years Belle was employed at the Clifton Lutheran Sunset Home as a nurse.</p>
<P>One of Belle's special interests is the piano. For some years she taught piano at home and at Cranfills Gap. She is the pianist of the family. While they lived on the farm, they were members of Our Savior's Lutheran Church, and during many of those years, Belle was the church organist. And for much of that time, Johnnie was the Sunday School Superintendent.</p>
<H3><a name="O.C-11.A">Mary Belle (Grandchild)</a></H3>, <P>a graduate of Clifton Junior College, was married to Lawrence Frank Kittenberry on March 22, 1947 in Dallas, Texas. They live in Dallas at 6539 Speight, 75232, where Lawrence (Bud) is in Industry as a welder. They have two sons: David Mitchell, born June 14, 1948 in Dallas, and now a student at Texas A & M; and Clay Thomas, born in Dallas, May 7, 1951, and now a student at U. T. Arlington.</p>
<H3><a name="O.C-11.C">Earl Christian (Grandchild)</a></H3>is a graduate of Clifton Junior College and is a B. B. A. graduate of The University of Texas.

<H3><a name="O.C-12"><a href=" https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/details/L2XG-R8L" target="_blank"><mark>VIOLA  CECELIA (twelfth child)</mark></a><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></H3>
<P>Viola Cecelia, the fifth girl and the twelfth child in the family, was born October 7, 1898, during the time of cotton picking days and the days of rattle snakes. She was named for Aunt C (Mrs. B. C. Martin), and the name "Viola" was used because that was the name Dad wanted for her. She was baptized November 20, 1898. Her God-Parents were Mr. and Mrs. M. Sorenson and the witnesses were Torger Nelson and Beatrice Anderson. She was confirmed on June 8, 1913.</p>
<P>Vi is one who can say that she stepped on a rattler without any serious mishap. Coming in from cotton picking, the day was spent and darkness was coming on as we reached home. This snake was coiled just in front of the front steps, Vi stepped on it  &mdash; with bare feet probably;&mdash; and jumped to the porch floor in one leap as she heard the rattle. We killed the snake.</p>
<P>Viola too attended the Harmony school, and is a graduate of Clifton Lutheran College. She taught school as her first endeavor away from home, teaching the Meridian Creek school. After two years of teaching, she joined sister May and Miss Anna Grimland, enrolling as nurse students at the Baptist Hospital in Waco, Texas in 1920. She was graduated from this institution and became a Registered Nurse in 1923. She followed this profession throughout her active years. She is also an Anesthetist, and was active as such for many years, but is now retired.</p>
<P>On January 25, 1928, she was married to Frank Edwin Smith in the family home in Clifton, Texas. Frank is now retired from his refrigeration service with Foremost Dairies. They have three children: James Weldon, Donald Curtis, and Dorothy Jean. They live at 4428 Amherst, Dallas, Texas 75225.</p>

<H3><a name="O.C"><mark>DAD AND MOTHER</mark></a></H3>
<p>Yes, Dad and Mother did an outstanding job of rearing their family. Sure, the circumstances of life, the details of procedures, and the methods of doing their necessary things now seem quite primitive when compared with modern conditions, with the hundreds of conveniences now in use that were unknown during the years when they were bringing up their family  &mdash; 1877 to 1927. Hundreds of gadgets and con-viences now common place were in their time unheard of. But, you see; mother and dad were both of them skilled in their own realm  &mdash; mother handled the house  &mdash; the home area in a masterful manner. Dad knew his place and department too. He had full charge of the place, the farm work, the livestock, and the detailed work of keeping everything ship-shape.</p>
<P>What did mother do? She did the cooking. When I was growing up, for instance, there were about 16 mouths to feed, and she did the bulk of the cooking and planning for this kitchen duty. You think 16 is too many? There were the 12 children, then mother and dad, grandmother Bronstad, and Leroy. Well, Leroy came along a bit later. Now, think too that mother fed us biscuits just about every morning for breakfast, and during the school months there were also enough biscuits for from 4 to 6 school lunches. She had biscuit pans that would hold 50 each and she had two of these. We enjoyed fruit and vegetables processed by mother, and raised on the farm. There was always plenty of milk, cream, eggs, and butter  &mdash; there were usually about 9 or 10 cows to milk. Sure, mother churned the butter &mdash; of course- the children all had their duties or chores to tend to; but you see that was a part of mother's duty too &mdash;the assigning of chores about the place, and, with it all, keep everybody happy. The girls especially helped mother about the house, and the boys were usually busy under Dad's direction, handling livestock and tending to field work.</p>
<P>Mother's work was not so easy. Her cook stove was a wood burner  &mdash; she had a good one. Of course she had to have wood in the kitchen in the wood box back of the stove. Who carried the wood? That depended on circumstances. But doubt it not  &mdash; Mother carried her share of it  &mdash;and uncomplainingly. We had a cellar. But, to get to it, Mother had to go outside and then down the steps to the cellar for her milk, the butter, the eggs, jars of preserves, etc. Then too, for many years there was a pantry just across a small porch just outside the kitchen door. So to get to her pots and pans, the stored supplies of all kinds, she had to go outside the house. Mother also took care of the chickens, turkeys, guineas and ducks. That was a part of her domain, and she knew how to handle her chickens. She raised her own chickens. The big plymouth rock setting hens hatched out about 15 chicks each, and the mother hens cared for the chicks. That of course gave the family a lot of Sunday Chicken dinners. Mother's fried chickens were a choice dish. Then there were other foods prepared by Mother that we remember. There were the cheeses. You see we had more milk than we needed, for normal daily use. So Mother made cheese. She made a cottage cheese, "gammel ost", musmur &mdash; there were different kinds of musmur, and all good. We recall a hard musmur that we would shave and mix in water and use it- as a refreshing drink. You see, nothing went to waste at our house. If there was too much milk for our use, the growing pigs got it.</p>
<P>How about soap? Well, when need demanded it, Mother engineered the making of soap. The old wash pot was put into use, with a brisk fire, along with lye, water, and fats boiled down, and sure enough there came out of it all a good supply of excellent soap, which, when cooled, would harden, and be cut out of the pot into pieces of varying sizes. This soap was mainly for use on clothes washing day, and that came every week. Our hand and face soap  &mdash; for the boys anyway &mdash; was "Grand Pa" soap and it was a good soap too &mdash; black and effective  &mdash; you see our hands would be "dirty".</p>
<P>When I think of Mother's cooking and meal preparing, there are several things that stand out. We have mentioned our milk supply. Well, sometimes some of our pans of milk were set on the table for supper  &mdash; usually two at the time. The situation? The milk had clabbered, and the rich cream was still on. Then we would add a bit of sugar sprinkled over the cream and we would help ourselves out of these pans, using tablespoons. That clabber milk with the cream and sugar was real tasty and we thrived on it. Sometimes, too, Mother had so much good, thick cream on hand that she simply placed a bowl of this good cream on the table. This we would add to whatever was on the table, such as peach or plum preserves, syrup, or musmur, and what more would a hungry human want! Hog plum preserves and thick cream made as good eating as anything I can think of.</p>
<P>And do you remember the "calve dance"? This was made from the first milk from a fresh milk cow. This milk was sort of thick and heavy. When prepared it came out as a thick custard. It was fine, but I would think that you had better know how to prepare this dish before you try to set it out for consumption!</p>
<P>Then there was also "blod kake", meaning "blood cake". On hog killing day Dad would have a pan on hand. Then when the hog was "stuck" in the neck &mdash; the artery was cut &mdash;Dad would catch this warm blood in the pan and one of us boys would hurry to the house where mother and/or grandmother would receive it and properly prepare it into edible cakes  &mdash; a delicacy in the judgment of some. I never learned to enjoy this "delicacy", but it certainly was distinctive preparation, and those who liked it were very fond of it. God bless them!</p>
<P>one of Mother's specialties that hit the spot with a hungry bunch of boys and girls for evening meals was what she called "save all". I believe it should be written "Saveall". This save-all was a preparation of left over bread pieces, cake, or any such like materials mixed with raisins and egg custard and maybe other things. Anyway this "save-all"&ndash;I believe this is a better spelling for it &ndash; was fully enjoyed by us all as an evening meal, and I doubt there was ever any of it left when we left the table.</p>
<P>Sunday dinners were often topped off with mother's "transparent" pie. I can't say how this was made, but it was a rich like pie, and we fully enjoyed it. It was somewhat like the modern chess pie, only better.</p>
<P>Another dish we often enjoyed as a part of Sunday Dinner was Sago Pudding with a good, generous supply of sweet cream.</p>
<P>Specialties at Christmas time were several, but I remember first the Christmas Eve "flute grot" &ndash; cream mush. This was rich stuff and as it was prepared, the fat from the cream rose to the top and this was spooned out to be applied to the mush when eaten. This was rich, and enjoyed by the whole family I would believe. Then there were "sand-bakles" and "fatigmansbakels". On Christmas morning we were treated to a glass of egg-nog, and a generous supply of orange and apple cuts. Then we were living high!</p>
<P>Some of these preparations were from the Norwegian heritage. Well, what else would you expect in a home with Norwegian forebears as was ours?</p>
<P>What else did mother do? Well, she took the raw cotton, spun it, wove it, and then made clothes out of it&ndash;dresses, shirts, underwear, and "homespun" pants. That may be a bit hard to believe, but that's the way I have it. Mother's spinning wheel is now in the Bosque County Museum.</p>
