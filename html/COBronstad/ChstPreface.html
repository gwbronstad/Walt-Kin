<P>In presenting the history of the C. O. Bronstad family, we will need to go back to the families from which CHRISTIAN 0. BRONSTAD AND MARTHA CHRISTINE COLWICK BRONSTAD came. This will take us back to Norway where both families originated.
Christian 0. Bronstad and Martha Christine Colwick Bronstad are the father and mother of our family, and will be so designated and called in the story. Ole Anderson Ajar Bronstad and his wife Christine Christensdatter Bronstad, and Ovee (Kjolvig) Colwick and Johanna Naadland Colwick are the parents of Christian 0. and Martha Bronstad, and are therefore the Grandparents in this story, and will be so called and referred to; and the children of C. 0. Bronstad family will be termed "the children", and the "brothers and sisters". Referring to myself, I will probably use the words "I, my, me, etc."</p>
<P>Besides the personal life history of each of the members of the family, we hope to show something of the circumstances and conditions affecting family and community life during the years covered by this narrative. Our forebears, of course, met, conquered, and lived and thrived under social and economic conditions far different from what our present generation enjoys. It must be true that every generation has found many perplexing problems to "worry over", but let it also be said that every generation has found much pleasure in life conditions as they existed in their time.</P>
<P>This "Bronstad Family Story" will tend to show the "Bronstads" as a typical rural Bosque County family of its time with problems and pleasures, and now expanded and scattered into ever widening circles, with the present (1970) generation making its contributions to the "better life" in these United States of America.</P>
<P>I realize and fully understand that incidents of much concern to individuals of the family, and interesting details of the life of our family, are missing in this story. I hope you will pardon these shortcomings. The only way I see out of such a situation is to urge each individual who finds such details missing to write his story, and add it to this one, and in that way preserve for later generations a more complete story. Such personal histories are very interesting, and definitely worth while.</P>

OUR FOREBEARS DREAMED<br>
THEY LOOKED AHEAD<br>

THEY FOUND THEIR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY<br>
THEY MADE THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS<br>
THEY WERE PLEASED AND HAPPY<br>
THEY ACHIEVED.</P>
