<H3><a name="0.C">DAD AND MOTHER</a></H3>
<p>Yes, Dad and Mother did an outstanding job of rearing their family. Sure, the circumstances of life, the details of procedures, and the methods of doing their necessary things now seem quite primitive when compared with modern conditions, with the hundreds of conveniences now in use that were unknown during the years when they were bringing up their family  &mdash; 1877 to 1927. Hundreds of gadgets and con-viences now common place were in their time unheard of. But, you see; mother and dad were both of them skilled in their own realm  &mdash; mother handled the house  &mdash; the home area in a masterful manner. Dad knew his place and department too. He had full charge of the place, the farm work, the livestock, and the detailed work of keeping everything ship-shape.</p>
<P>What did mother do? She did the cooking. When I was growing up, for instance, there were about 16 mouths to feed, and she did the bulk of the cooking and planning for this kitchen duty. You think 16 is too many? There were the 12 children, then mother and dad, grandmother Bronstad, and Leroy. Well, Leroy came along a bit later. Now, think too that mother fed us biscuits just about every morning for breakfast, and during the school months there were also enough biscuits for from 4 to 6 school lunches. She had biscuit pans that would hold 50 each and she had two of these. We enjoyed fruit and vegetables processed by mother, and raised on the farm. There was always plenty of milk, cream, eggs, and butter  &mdash; there were usually about 9 or 10 cows to milk. Sure, mother churned the butter &mdash; of course- the children all had their duties or chores to tend to; but you see that was a part of mother's duty too &mdash;the assigning of chores about the place, and, with it all, keep everybody happy. The girls especially helped mother about the house, and the boys were usually busy under Dad's direction, handling livestock and tending to field work.</p>
<P>Mother's work was not so easy. Her cook stove was a wood burner  &mdash; she had a good one. Of course she had to have wood in the kitchen in the wood box back of the stove. Who carried the wood? That depended on circumstances. But doubt it not  &mdash; Mother carried her share of it  &mdash;and uncomplainingly. We had a cellar. But, to get to it, Mother had to go outside and then down the steps to the cellar for her milk, the butter, the eggs, jars of preserves, etc. Then too, for many years there was a pantry just across a small porch just outside the kitchen door. So to get to her pots and pans, the stored supplies of all kinds, she had to go outside the house. Mother also took care of the chickens, turkeys, guineas and ducks. That was a part of her domain, and she knew how to handle her chickens. She raised her own chickens. The big plymouth rock setting hens hatched out about 15 chicks each, and the mother hens cared for the chicks. That of course gave the family a lot of Sunday Chicken dinners. Mother's fried chickens were a choice dish. Then there were other foods prepared by Mother that we remember. There were the cheeses. You see we had more milk than we needed, for normal daily use. So Mother made cheese. She made a cottage cheese, "gammel ost", musmur &mdash; there were different kinds of musmur, and all good. We recall a hard musmur that we would shave and mix in water and use it- as a refreshing drink. You see, nothing went to waste at our house. If there was too much milk for our use, the growing pigs got it.</p>
<P>How about soap? Well, when need demanded it, Mother engineered the making of soap. The old wash pot was put into use, with a brisk fire, along with lye, water, and fats boiled down, and sure enough there came out of it all a good supply of excellent soap, which, when cooled, would harden, and be cut out of the pot into pieces of varying sizes. This soap was mainly for use on clothes washing day, and that came every week. Our hand and face soap  &mdash; for the boys anyway &mdash; was "Grand Pa" soap and it was a good soap too &mdash; black and effective  &mdash; you see our hands would be "dirty".</p>
<P>When I think of Mother's cooking and meal preparing, there are several things that stand out. We have mentioned our milk supply. Well, sometimes some of our pans of milk were set on the table for supper  &mdash; usually two at the time. The situation? The milk had clabbered, and the rich cream was still on. Then we would add a bit of sugar sprinkled over the cream and we would help ourselves out of these pans, using tablespoons. That clabber milk with the cream and sugar was real tasty and we thrived on it. Sometimes, too, Mother had so much good, thick cream on hand that she simply placed a bowl of this good cream on the table. This we would add to whatever was on the table, such as peach or plum preserves, syrup, or musmur, and what more would a hungry human want! Hog plum preserves and thick cream made as good eating as anything I can think of.</p>
<P>And do you remember the "calve dance"? This was made from the first milk from a fresh milk cow. This milk was sort of thick and heavy. When prepared it came out as a thick custard. It was fine, but I would think that you had better know how to prepare this dish before you try to set it out for consumption!</p>
<P>Then there was also "blod kake", meaning "blood cake". On hog killing day Dad would have a pan on hand. Then when the hog was "stuck" in the neck &mdash; the artery was cut &mdash;Dad would catch this warm blood in the pan and one of us boys would hurry to the house where mother and/or grandmother would receive it and properly prepare it into edible cakes  &mdash; a delicacy in the judgment of some. I never learned to enjoy this "delicacy", but it certainly was distinctive preparation, and those who liked it were very fond of it. God bless them!</p>
<P>one of Mother's specialties that hit the spot with a hungry bunch of boys and girls for evening meals was what she called "save all". I believe it should be written "Saveall". This save-all was a preparation of left over bread pieces, cake, or any such like materials mixed with raisins and egg custard and maybe other things. Anyway this "save-all"&ndash;I believe this is a better spelling for it &ndash; was fully enjoyed by us all as an evening meal, and I doubt there was ever any of it left when we left the table.</p>
<P>Sunday dinners were often topped off with mother's "transparent" pie. I can't say how this was made, but it was a rich like pie, and we fully enjoyed it. It was somewhat like the modern chess pie, only better.</p>
<P>Another dish we often enjoyed as a part of Sunday Dinner was Sago Pudding with a good, generous supply of sweet cream.</p>
<P>Specialties at Christmas time were several, but I remember first the Christmas Eve "flute grot" &ndash; cream mush. This was rich stuff and as it was prepared, the fat from the cream rose to the top and this was spooned out to be applied to the mush when eaten. This was rich, and enjoyed by the whole family I would believe. Then there were "sand-bakles" and "fatigmansbakels". On Christmas morning we were treated to a glass of egg-nog, and a generous supply of orange and apple cuts. Then we were living high!</p>
<P>Some of these preparations were from the Norwegian heritage. Well, what else would you expect in a home with Norwegian forebears as was ours?</p>
<P>What else did mother do? Well, she took the raw cotton, spun it, wove it, and then made clothes out of it&ndash;dresses, shirts, underwear, and "homespun" pants. That may be a bit hard to believe, but that's the way I have it. Mother's spinning wheel is now in the Bosque County Museum.</p>
<P>Then throughout the year, a-bout every month or so, mother rounded up us boys and with her scissors she gave us all haircuts. She could do it well, and did it until about the time that we were big enough to "fly the coop". Another matter that mother was concerned about was the pillows and mattresses on the place. You see we had ducks. What for? I don't think we used the duck eggs for kitchen use, but for duck production. But the feathers! Each spring we rounded up the ducks in the wash house, and then mother "picked" them at molting time. That means that she plucked out the ducks' feathers. When she was through with the duck, it looked real scrawny and helpless &ndash; she was undressed. But she soon grew a new set of feathers. The plucked feathers were used for pillows and feather mattresses. What better pillows would you want?</p>
<P>We also, after threshing time, filled our bed sacks with fresh straw &ndash; so our mattress problem was solved.
And mother was also the one we went to when we needed help of any kind. When we became sick, we went to mother. If we stubbed our toes real bad, we went to mother. When we cut a finger or knee with a too sharp knife, we went to mother. She was a pretty good doctor and knew when the complaint was a legitimate one, and when it was a try for sympathy. In either case she would heal the wound smoothly. Here are some of the medicines and healers she used. In a real case of being sick, she went to the bureau drawer and took out the brown bottle with the Calomel tablets. That was rather potent stuff, and effective. Then at times she went for the Syrup of Figs bottle, and a table-spoon of that stuff usually did the job. A little cut of some kind and she brought out the Jo-He. This was a small metal container about the size of our modern mentholatum containers. This was a smooth liquid which had a soothing effect. It was in a screw-top container. For a wasp sting, we looked for the blueing bottle, or we spit on the dust and applied the wet dirt &ndash; we believed it soothed the wound.</p>
<P>Then on occasions mother would be called on to be present and receive, and care for newborn babies in the community.</p>
<P>Another thing that was kept in the cellar was our supply of sausages. Following hog killing time came sausage time. The pork was cut into small pieces, then the meat grinder was set up and the pork ground. Next mother would apply the proper seasoning, and in proper amounts, working the seasoning into the ground pork, working it up with her bare hands. Next came the frying of the sausages. Then large crocks were cleansed and the sausages put into them. Next and by that time lard had been rendered, the melted lard was poured over the sausages until the crocks were full. When these cooled, the supply of sausages for the year was safely packed away. As they were wanted during the year, they were spooned out and heated for some real tasty meals. Those sausages surely went fine with the biscuits in our lunch buckets at school. Of course, mother engineered this whole process.</p>
<P>"Mother's work is never done',' someone said. But my mother's work was done &ndash; well, completely, and cheerfully; but it was a continuing process, it seemed. It would fill a book&ndash;mother's full story of her daily activities would. Her work was so varied in kinds and in detailed processes that it becomes almost unbelievable. Her life was filled with service to her family and friends; and sometimes I fear we just took her and her love for granted. Her life was filled with service and she was happy in it all. Here she helped one of us, there she helped another one with some problem, next she would instruct quietly another in her school spelling lesson, next she would wrap a sore finger &ndash; which had been bumped in school, and she might listen to a bit of argument between a couple of us and brush it off with a kind suggestion that settled the difficulty. Through all this give and take between the members of the family, mother remained the quiet peacemaker, and went about spreading cheer and love. I don't know that I ever found her out of sorts, or angered, or "yelling at" her children or anyone else. She was a wonderful mother. It must be
said too that she was strong and sturdy, even tempered, and an optimist.</p>
<P>And it can be said that all of us twelve children were NOT bottle-fed.</p>
<P>And hearing the coffee grinder early in the morning &ndash; that was a signal to get out of bed and get ready for breakfast and the day's work.</p>
<P>And I can still remember the distinct smell of green coffee being roasted on top of the stove.</p>
<P>And then there was the day when mother's mother hen brought home with her brood of little guinea chicks, a large covey of quail &ndash; they were beauties!</p>
<P>And then there was the time one of the boys robbed a buzzard nest&ndash;or was it a crow's nest&ndash; and placed the eggs along with the chicken eggs under the setting hen!</p>
<P>Did mother find enjoyment in life? Most surely! The Roman said, "my children are my jewels". So with Mother &ndash; and with Dad too &ndash; their children were "their jewels".</p>
<P>Our Dad was the &quot;captain&quot; in charge. As such he was easy going and understanding in his dealings with everybody. Yes, he set up work for us all, but he did not "drive" us. He knew what we could do, what we should do, and then he expected us to carry out our part of the farm assignments. In turn, we learned that we benefited ourselves and all concerned when we did out duty, and carried our part of the load. Dad knew his farm, the livestock, his implements, and had a very fine setup on the place for successful operations. And he "worked". He always sort of set the pace. He would be the first to be ready to go to work. He would call out "time, to go", or some such thing. At other times he would simply get up and go, and we automatically fell in line and went to work too. There was little lost motion. Dad took care of the horses and mules, and pigs, and the cattle too. He knew his horses and what they could do, and took pride in them. He saw to it that the harness, collars, etc. were in good repair and condition. He was a good horseman.</p>
<P>He had planned the farm's operations masterfully, following rotation of crops regularly. He knew when to get his crops started, when to get the plowing, etc. done, and what to feed his stock. He did most of the hauling of products to market. On occasions he let one or more of his boys ride to town on the loads of wheat, cotton, and other produce for market, and those were red letter days for us. He did not do much cotton picking or chopping because he had plenty of team work to do at those times.</p>
<P>On hog killing day, Dad was in charge of dressing the porkers he &mdash; sometimes one of the Boys &mdash;would shoot the hog. Then we had to drag it out of the pen and on to a sled. Then we came with the sturdy, stand-by horse, Jim, and he would drag the hog to the butchering place near the pot in which was boiling water. You see, not any horse would do this. The smell of blood stirs up a horse, it did Jim, but he was a fine trusty horse and might snort a bit, but seemed to assume the responsibility and do the job. Then came the scraping of the hog and dressing it. Dad was the expert at that. When cooled, the bacon sides and the hams were then salted down in the smokehouse for use as needs demanded during the year. (Incidentally, when we had the hog killings we always used the heart and liver, and some fresh pork chops. And were these good? But you see there were times that I ate too much of this fresh stuff, and then at school I would get stomach upset&ndash;just plain bellyache&ndash;and I would be in distress and trouble. But, anyway, it sure was good eating.)</p>
<P>Speaking of Dad as an expert, I guess he was a real expert at chopping wood. Our fuel for heat on the farm was of course wood. We had a mountain pasture, and there was lots of wood there. Well, during the winter months Dad would saddle a horse, carry lunch, and go to chop wood. He stacked this pole wood. Later then he hauled the pole wood home and there chopped and split it into the proper size sticks for stove use. Dad knew just how to handle the axe, and with remarkably short time would have a huge stack of fire wood. Some wood was cut into "cord wood" fashion. This was for use at threshing time. The steam engines used wood and the farmers had to furnish wood for that purpose. I seem to remember that one time Dad let his axe slip on him and he cut his foot&ndash;rather badly, but he soon recovered and was back in full stride again.</p>
<P>Dad's grindstone was a very important item on the farm. The stone was fixed on a four legged stand &ndash; with a handle for turning it, and had a water can fixed so as to drip water on the revolving stone. You see the axe, knives, and other tools had to be sharp- The old grindstone would get the job done.</p>
<P>About once a year we had our calf-branding and colt-branding. We would build a fire in the cow lot, get the "Block B" iron hot, and then, along with a sizzling sound, our young stock were marked with our brand.</p>
<P>We had our family devotions usually with Dad in charge &ndash; this at meal time and or at bed time.</p>
<P>Then when Dad would wind the clock we knew that it was time to get quiet, and get to sleep.
We all seemed to enjoy another little detail &ndash; the trimming of the horses' manes. The ponies and horses that were used for buggy service usually had their mane trimmed. And the mules were also thus trimmed and had their tails trimmed back. Why have the mule tails trimmed? I don't know, but that was the general practice, so we kept ours trimmed too.</p>
<P>You might think that on rainy days there would be time for Dad to relax. Well, he did sometimes. But you see there were things for him to do on rainy days too. He would probably have a few pairs of shoes to half-sole. Dad was good at that work, and he half-soled dozens of shoes in his time. At other times when rain kept us out of the fields, Dad would go to the barn and repair harness, or shoe a horse, or he might call us with him to sweep and clean up the corn bin or wheat bin to get ready for the new crop. Then at times Dad would have us kids pull cockle-burs or sunflowers along the branch. Dad just would not allow these weeds to grow, and after a rain they were easily pulled up. Another thing that Dad fought like sin was Johnson grass. We had a few spots of this grass on the place, and we pretty well kept it from spreading, but we were never able to fully eradicate it &ndash; work on it was sometimes done when it was "too wet to plow". Another piece of work that we took care of following rains was to check and repair the fences. Of course, while the rain fell, we kids would play. Play what? Maybe dominoes, crokenole, authors, flinch, rook, and also a baseball game. We had the diamond marked off on the table, and we used dominoes for men, a pencil was the bat and a crokenole ring was the ball. We had some hot games. Dad would enjoy watching us play, but as far as I know of, he did not enter into our games. At times we would think that we were "cought up" with our work and that Dad would have time to rest; but then we would see him climb the windmill tower on a grease job; or he might come out with a paint brush and a can of paint to brighten up the "glugs" to the cellar, or the several gates about the premises &ndash;there were plenty of things needing paint jobs. Or next we would see him &ndash; and help him &ndash; grease the wagons and buggies. Or there would be a young horse or mule that needed to be made bridle-wise and harness-wise. So we would hitch the animal to the wagon along with our old trusty horse, Jim, and away we went down the pasture and round about. Dad supervised the breaking of all his horses and mules. You see, Dad was a master at the art of farming. He kept the place in "ship shape", and he did it quietly, precisely, effec'ively, regularly, pleasantly, completely, but there was a lot of real planning, and a lot of labor. It didn't just happen that he &ndash;and mother&ndash;put together a-bout 550 acres of land, a large and well kept home, and raised well a large family. He worked at it, but when it was all done, he did not regret his years of toil and family life. He was happy and pleased with the years spent on the farm. Generally speaking, he was a happy man.</p>
<P>Shortly after he had been in Texas long enough to acquire citizenship, he got busy and applied. He was granted his American Citizenship on May 19, 1880. J. K. Helton was the County Judge, and F. M. Collier was the County Clerk, his witnesses were Ovee Colwick and Christian Canuteson.</p>
<P>Our Dad understood the importance of education, and, although his time was pretty well filled with his many duties on the farm, he gave freely of his time to school matters in his community, his county, and his church. He served as school trustee in the Harmony School District during the years 1891-1893; 1895-1896; 1899-1900; 1902-1903; 1907-1909; 1911-1913.</p>
<P>When the County School Board was authorized in 1911, our Dad was appointed County School Trustee. He served three years on this Board &ndash; 1911-1913.</p>
<P>To round out his school activities, Dad served as Trustee of Clifton Lutheran College, Clifton, Texas, for one term of three years.</p>
<P>Our Dad &ndash; his friends called him "Chris"&ndash;was a rather quiet, unassuming, gentle man. He was not boisterous or belligerent. He spoke deliberately, but rather firmly. He would make himself clearly understood. His personal life was pretty much the same&ndash; gentle, unpretentious, with a friendly gesture and smile for those he met. And, yes, he was a bearded man. I never saw him without a beard. If someone needed help, he was ready and more than willing to help. It is well remembered that during the long, hot summers two of our neighbors would be without water for home use. Our 40 foot windmill kept us well supplied with water. So our two neighbors hauled water from our tank in barrels. Dad would watch the water level in our windmill water reservoir very carefully. And, as I recall, he did worry some about whether or not the wind would continue to blow enough to bring up sufficient supply of water for the three families. But as far as I can remember, we never were without water. Of course, the two neighbors who used our water never had to pay for what they got. You see, the people in those days were neighborly, and were ready to help each other when help was needed.</p>
<P>How did Dad control his boys &ndash;and girls as well? That's a good question, and the full answer is probably not so easy to find. As far as I know, he never whipped a son of his. I do not believe he ever laid hands on any of his children. He had ways of expression in words and looks that showed us his feelings. He would show disgust or surprise when we would do or say the wrong thing. But when we were right, he would show pleased approval. He warned carefully against wrong doings and wrong speaking and wrong approaches to problems and actions. He carefully instructed us in what he wanted done,. and then he expected us to do the job assigned. When specific jobs were done well, and when our behavior was correct, he would be happy and would show by looks and words that he was pleased. And that went a long way in keeping us doing what was right, and leaving off what was not right, correct, gentlemanly, or acceptable. Praise from Dad was appreciated, and was effective in the control of us children. Also it must be remembered that Dad was a staunch cnnstian, and he led a rather exemplary life and we were brought up in the Christian church, and we received solid Christian training in the Lutheran Church. Yes, surely that helped in the control of the family of seven boys and five girls.</p>
<P>But, yes, Dad could get riled and "hot". But this would show, not so much against any of the children, but because of things that might go wrong in the operation of the place. For instance, when Daisy, a big fine sorrel mare broke out of the lot when she was not expected or supposed to, and Dad threw a rock at her and broke her front leg below the knee. Dad's response? "Boys, don't ever throw a stone at a horse."</p>
<P>But, 'tis true. Things were not always "peaches and cream" for Dad and Mother. There were droughts and lean years. The market price for farm products was sometimes very low. Sickness in the family would come&ndash; ten of us had the measles at the same time. We got by without rattlesnake bites, but the little black-widow spiders put some to bed. The plaque of grasshoppers hurt the cotton crops some years. Then the Mexican boll weavel appeared and was destructive. So, surely, there were disappointing and discouraging situations that appeared. But it seemed that following each set-back, Dad and Mother would bounce back stronger than ever. No doubt, Dad's good credit rating helped them through the rougher years.</p>
<P>One interesting feature of rural community life, as practiced by neighbors during our years on the farm, was the "Beef Club". Usually, there would be eight families in such a club. Taking turns, every week a member would butcher a beef on Friday, and would deliver a portion of the beef to each member family. The beef would be divided into parts as upper hind quarter, lower hind quarter, upper front quarter and lower front quarter. Thus, if everything worked out right, each member family in the club, in a period of eight weeks, would have received each quarter of a beef. The difference in weights of the sections received and the sections delivered would be adjusted by money exchange. Such clubs were common practice during those times, and the fresh beef thus received was a delight to the families concerned.</p>
<P>Now when all the members of our family have reached the retirement age, and we make a hurried review of the whole group, we find that we make a rather good looking group. There seems to be not a single bad egg in the bunch. Sure, we have all been&ndash;and those still living are &ndash;sinners. But we seem to have lived fairly well. Two remained single, and the others have reared families, and maybe we should say they are good families. True enough, we have none of us reached the highest place in state or church; and we have not massed together this world's goods into quantities to be marveled at. At least, as far as I know, we have not massed together the millions we read a-bout.</p>
<P>We seem to have inherited from our parents a sense of right, justice, and good judgment. Also, we seem to have inherited an understanding of, and love of, and faith in the Divine. Or is it so that we do not inherit such things, but rather inherit the opposite tendencies, and that the good understanding, love, and faith come from environment, come from training, come from home training plus church training? Anyway, I think that we did inherit a good name and good qualities. This then, coupled with good home training and church discipline and instruction, has served us well.</p>
<P>We have all had pleasant lives, with just enough of the adversities to keep us in check. We have all made our own way in life, have enjoyed life, and have maintained good Christian homes for our families and friends. We have served in various ways in church, community, state and national affairs as befits good citizens. This service has been given because we have loved our church and country. We have all been good Americans, and believing and repentant Christians.</p>
<P>Praise and thanks to Dad and Mother! How they raised us all so well is now a bit hard to fully understand, if considered in the light of modern standards. But, thank God, they did it! And may we never cease thanking our good and great God for His great love, and protecting care, down through the years of the C. 0. Bronstad Family &ndash; the past years, the present time, and the years to come.
