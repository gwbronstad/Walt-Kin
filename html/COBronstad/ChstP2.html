<h1 style="column-span: all; text-align: center;"> C. O. Bronstad Family History Part II of V</h1><hr style="column-span: all;">

<a name="COB"></a>
<P>In 1873 Christian O. Bronstad, while recuperating from his severe case of typhoid fever, came to the Ovee Colwick home to call on a Mr. Fred Huse who had crossed the waters with him, and was staying with the Colwicks. It is related that this young Norwegian walked right in, turned around, and closed the door, and then turned to those in the room and said "howdy". </P>
<P>Although Martha Colwick related that he did not look like much at that time, as he had been sick, yet, there we have the beginning of the romance. Later, one Sunday afternoon while Chris and Martha were out horseback riding, they stopped at Dr. Olson's Drug Store at Norway Mills. There Chris bought a pair of gold cuff links for his lady friend, Martha. This case developed and grew, and led to their wedding day, March 1, 1877.</P>
<P>However, Wednesday, February 28, 1877, was a very bad day. A heavy rain fell. The next day, March 1, 1877 was the day set for the double wedding in the Colwick home. Dr. 0. M. Olson and Margaret Colwick, and Christian O. Bronstad and Martha Colwick. Chris, the miller, was at Norway Mills, south of Neils Creek, and the Colwick home was located north of Neils Creek. Chris felt that he must needs be at the Colwick home for that wedding, and so to avoid a possible disaster of a swollen and flooded creek, he got a man to care for the mill, and he, on Wednesday evening, took precautions and crossed the creek.
And this brings us to Thursday, March 1, 1877, the day of the wedding</P>

MOTHER AND DAD
Wedding Picture
March 1877. (Mr. and Mrs. C. O. Bronstad)

<P>As it turned out, March 1st was a beautiful day, and just before noon the ceremony took place, uniting these two couples in marriage. The Reverend Ole Estrem performed the ceremony. The licenses were issued by County Clerk Mr. F. M. Collier. The attendants were: <mark>G. O. Bronstad</mark>, Olivia Colwick (Mrs. T. A. Eggen), T. Theodore Colwick, Matilda Olson (Mrs. Shefstad), John N. Colwick, Josie Olson (Mrs. Canute Canuteson), L. Erickson, Christine Colwick (Mrs. Mat Anderson). This wedding was a big and interesting affair. A big dinner was served. Mrs. B. C. Martin, the beloved aunt of the brides, was the supervisor of the dinner. </P>
<P>For about two years, the young miller and his wife lived in their new two room house at "The Mill". While living at Norway Mills, their first child, Cora Josephine, was born January 17, 1878. Then they lived for about a year on the Colwick farm. Next they moved to their newly acquired farm in the Meridian creek valley. This farm was a one hundred acre block of land, and he paid $3.00 per acre. There they built a two room house with "up stairs". And there on their farm they continued to live until they retired in 1924, and moved to the city of Clifton.</p>
<P>As the family grew, the house grew too with improvements made and rooms added from time to time. So too with regard to barns, granaries, sheds, lots, and corrals as they became necessary. The farm also grew, as is shown by the records of the following purchases:</p>
<blockquote>
<br>Tract No. 1, Allen Talbot Survey, 100 acres, J. N. Colwick <br>
to C. O. Bronstad<br>
<br>Tract No. 2, Allan Talbot Survey, 102 acres, Ole Erickson <br>
to C. O. Bronstad<br>
<br>Tract No. 3, K. Nystel Survey, 35 and one-fourth acres, T. W. Anderson <br>
to C. O. Bronstad<br>
<br>Tract No. 4, Allan Talbot and K. Nystel Survey, <br>
for 25 and 30 and one-fourth acres, Syver Anderson <br>
to C. O. Bronstad<br>
<br>Tract No. 5, Allan Talbot Survey. 60 acres S. Samuelson <br>
to C. O. Bronstad<br>
<br>Tract No. 6, Talbot and Nystel Survey, 18 and four-fifth acres, <br>
Elias Nelson to C. O. Bronstad<br>
<br>Tract No. 7, Allan Talbot Survey, 110 acres, Mrs. C. Bergstrom <br>
to C. O. Bronstad Allan Talbot Survey, 3 acres, Mrs. C. Bergstrom <br>
to C. O. Bronstad Allan Talbot Survey, 50 acres, Mrs. C. Bergstrom <br>
to C. O. Bronstad <br>
<br>Tract No. 8, Allan Talbot Survey, 21 and one-half acres, Ole J. Hoel <br>
to C. O. Bronstad <br>
</blockquote>
<P>So the farm grew from the original 100 acres to 550 acres. And at the time of retirement in 1924, the 550 acres were all paid for and in good condition; and the twelve children were all "on their own". So we say "Well Done".</p>
<P>Not only did the original farm grow during the years from the beginning in 1881 to retirement in 1924. The family grew too. There were twelve children born to the C. O. Bronstads: seven boys and five girls. It took a lot of work and a lot of living and love to bring up this family. But those were happy years for every one concerned.</p>
<P>Family ties grow strong under such conditions. Sure, each one was an individual with certain distinct characteristics and each was possessed with certain distinct ideas, strong points and weaker points, but, putting it all together. Chris and Martha Bronstad developed a rather closely knit and interesting family where there was a lot of play, a lot of work, a lot of give-and-take, a minimum of dissention and arguments, a lot of love, and a lot of Christian living. Oh yes, there were arguments and debates. You can be sure of that. But those affairs, seemingly grave at the time, would rather quickly be amicably settled, and family life would move ahead pleasantly.</p>
<P>Looking back over the years of the existence of the C. O. Bronstad' family, 1877 to now, 1970, we find direct descendants and their spouses engaged in a variety of occupations, professions, and activities. They are now and or have been active in the following lines: Christian Pastors, teachers, bookkeepers, insurance agents, F. B. I. agents, farmers, U. S. postal employees, medical doctors, appraisers, accountants, merchants, business executives, bankers, organists, artists, insurance adjusters, electricians, salesmen, college professors, carpenters, lawyers, C. P. A's, engineers, gasoline plant superintendent, mechanics, nurses, bus drivers, U. S. military personnel, paper boys, carpenters, et. al.</p>
<P>Of the twelve children, ten were married. Millie and May remained single. Those married all had children. We give herewith a short account of the lives of each of the twelve, and their families.</p>
<P><H3> <A NAME = "0.C-1"><a href="https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/details/LC5X-TC1" target="_blank"><mark>CORA JOSEPHINE (first child)</mark></a><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></H3><br>
<p>Cora Josephine is the oldest child of our family. Cora was born January 17, 1878 at Norway Mills, Bosque County, Texas, during the time of the community water well, and grew up during the time of the Blueback speller. She was baptized by Rev. O. A. Alfson, February 17, 1878: witnesses were Mrs. Andrew Knudson, Christine Kjolvig, Gulbrand Bronstad, and Oscar Pederson. She was confirmed June 3, 1894. She was named for her grandmothers, Christine Bronstad and Johanna Colwick.</p>
<P>All other members of the family were baptized by Rev. J. K. Rystad; all the children were confirmed by Rev. J. K. Rystad.</p>
<P>Cora attended three community schools, the Fields School, the Bee Creek School, and the Harmony School. Later she attended the Waco Female College.
Cora's great joy is her family of children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren; and rightly so. They are a fine group. But I would also say that she enjoyed thoroughly her many years teaching in Sunday School, and doing other church and civic work.</p>
<P>She was married to Charlie A. Brown March 2, 1902 in Our Savior's Lutheran Church, Norse. Three children were born to this family: Milton Clyde, Myrtle Helen, and Carl Alvin. Milton Clyde was born February 8, 1903, Clifton, Texas; Myrtle Helen was born December 13, 1904, at Clifton, Texas; and Carl Alvin was born April 15, 1907, at Clifton, Texas. The family first lived in Clifton, but later moved to their farm home in the Harmony community, and there the children grew up.</p>

<P>On retirement they moved to Clifton, and then for some years they resided in the Clifton Lutheran Sunset Home, where Cora now lives; her husband Charlie died March 17, 1965.</p>
<P>For Cora's wedding, there was a week or more of serious and concerted planning and preparation. The big wedding dinner had to be planned and prepared. To superintend this planning and cooking Mrs. Ilsing was brought in. She spent days at it, baking cakes, cookies, bread, etc. When I tried to snatch a cookie or some cake crumbs, or some such thing, she promptly ran me out of the house. For the dinner, a tent was arranged, and set up along the wall of the house, and in this tent, a long table was set up. And for seating, long benches were used. And that was the scene of the big wedding dinner. There were people all over the place. We kids had a big time too, playing and chasing each other. One girl was knocked cold, but she recovered. One fight developed and took place out at the windmill. It was a day to remember.</p>
