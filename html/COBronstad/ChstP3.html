<H3><a name="0.C-4">OVEE KLENG (fourth child)</a></H3>
Ovee Kleng (Cleng) was the second son and the fourth child in the family. He was born June 11, 1883, during the time of the bind cutters and the "feeders" with the threshing crew (The cutting and the feeding of the thresher done by hand). He was baptized August 12, 1883. His God-Parents were Grandparents Ole and Christine Bronstad, and the witnesses were Otto and Syverine Bronstad, and he was named for Grandpa Ovee Colwick and Kleng Peerson, the pioneer trailblazer and colonizer. He was confirmed on June 4, 1899. He died in Ft. Worth, April 18, 1966.
<P>While Ovee was a young man on the farm, our big bay horse "Selum", Ovee called him "Babe", was his riding horse. And he found that "Babe" had an "electric button" right at the point where the backbone and the hip bone met. When this point was pressed, "Babe" would kick up his hind quarters. And Ovee was a good actor. It is remembered that when mother served okra the first time, it was rather sticky and stringy. And Ovee put on a show on how to eat it, holding it high above his head and catching it in his mouth as it strung out from the fork.</p>
<P>After attending the Harmony school, he followed Oscar's pattern and enrolled in Toby's Practical Business College in Waco; and while in Waco he lived with Uncle Lauris and Aunt Andrea Nelson. He started his work in the business world as bookkeeper with Dittrick Brothers in Clifton. Later he went to Ft. Worth, Texas and was associated with Ellison Furniture and Carpet Co., through the rest of his life, as Bookkeeper, Secretary - Treasurer, Vice-President, and General Manager. He retired in 1956, but continued with his Company as Director and Advisor.</p>
<P> He was a member of the Kiwanis Club where he had a record of 17 years perfect attendance. For many years he had charge of the finances of Hemphill Presbyterian Church, where he was a member.</p>

Theodore Colwick. He was baptized August 30, 1885, God-Parents being Mr. and Mrs. T. W. Anderson, and the witnesses were Syverine, Karen and Otto Bronstad. He was confirmed June 16, 1901.
<P>Let it be stated here that Morris has a twin brother, Conrad-Like-twins. [sic] And even now when they are in their 80's they can fool people as to their identity, although I can say that, as for me, they have never fooled me. They are usually listed as Morris being the older, but they still get into arguments about that, that maybe there was a mistake made early in their life about who is who and which is which.</p>
<P>While a young man on the farm, Morris played baseball on a "Harmony team" as did his twin, Conrad, also. They played in home-made uniforms. The baseball pants were made of white ducking, with colored streamers sewed along the side seams.
Morris, of course, attended the Harmony school, a typical one room, one teacher rural school. Then a year at Clifton Lutheran College, and then attended Toby's Practical Business College, Waco; and while in Waco, he lived with Uncle Lauris and Aunt Andrea Nelson on North 12th Street.</p>
<P>After his time with Toby's, he started his work with Clifton Lumber Co. with Mr. Townsend. Later he went to Denison where he associated with Lingo-Leeper Lumber Co. During his many active years, he was with this firm in various capacities. He is a member of the Denison Rotary Club.</p>
<P>Morris was married to Ruby Quest in June, 1909. Ruby died December 20, 1910, Clifton, Texas. Then on November 15, 1915, he was married to Leta Woody at Durant, Oklahoma. To this union one son, Morris Theodore Jr., was born.</p>
<P>Morris and Leta live at 1018 West Bond St., Denison, Texas 75020.</p>
<H4><a name="0.C-5.A">Morris Theodore Junior (grandchild)</a></H4> was born February 25, 1921 in Denison. He is a University of Texas graduate, and an M. D. located in Ft. Worth, Texas. Ted, as he is usually called, was married December 20, 1946, to Ruth Leane Hunt, in Dallas, Texas. Three sons were born to this family. Morris Theodore III, born Nov. 30, 1948 in Ann Arbor, Michigan; Christoffer Hunt, born January 10, 1952, in Ft. Worth, Texas; and David Karl, born June 6, 1954, at Victoria, Texas. These three boys are all in school now (1970). Ruth Leane, Ted's wife, died July 13, 1969.
Ted's home address is Ft. Worth, Texas, 6471 Floyd Drive, 76116.
<H3><a name="0.C-6">CONRAD GULBRAND (sixth child)</a></H3>
<p>Conrad Gulbrand is the sixth child and the fourth son in the family. He was born July 31, 1885, during the time of corn top cutting and bale-a-day cotton picking. He was named for Dad, Christian, and Uncle Gulbrand Bronstad. He was baptized August 30, 1885. His God Parents were Mr. and Mrs. T. W. Anderson, and the witnesses were Syverine, Karen and Otto Bronstad. He was confirmed June 16, 1901.</p>
<P>He attended the Harmony school, Clifton Lutheran College, and Toby's Practical Business College. It might be stated that on the graduation diplomas from Toby's, the twin's grades show up, and do they show up! The grades are not averaged to 100 not quite. And of course Conrad also lived with Uncle Lauris and Aunt Andrea Nelson while in school in Waco.</p>
<P>Conrad started his work in the business world as bookkeeper with the Oscar J. Rea store in Clifton. Next he went to Cranfills Gap with the G. 0. Bronstad store. Then next he was with Schow Brothers in Clifton. Next he was with The Clifton Mercantile Co. as Bookkeeper, as Secretary-Treasurer, and next as President and General Manager of the Company. Mr. 0. C. Orbeck was the first President of The Clifton Mercantile Co., but on his death, Conrad became the President of the firm, Guardian of the Orbeck children and Co-Executor of the Orbeck Estate. For 35 years he was with this Company in the various capacities. But when the Orbeck children all became of age, he retired and turned the business over to them. He is a charter member and a Past President of the Clifton Lions Club.</p>
<P>While Conrad was living in Cranfills Gap, before his marriage, he came home to the farm one Saturday evening. On the way he encountered a skunk, and the animal did its thing in a big way. On Sunday Conrad washed his horse, his harness, the buggy and himself, but still the "smell" was there. We sort of thought it was funny. He didn't. You see, he had a date in Clifton. So the problem. But, you know, love will find a way! </p>
<P>On December 5, 1907, Conrad was married to Olena Aleda Grimland. This was the first wedding held in the then new Lutheran Church in Clifton. To this marriage two children were born: Byron Grady, born November 9, 1911 in Clifton, and Hazel Fern, born August 31, 1917 in Clifton. Olena died December 27, 1969 in Clifton.</p>

<H4><a name="0.C-6.B">Hazel Fern (grandchild)</a></H4>, a graduate of Clifton Junior College, was married to William Ralston McDowell in Clifton, Texas, September 15, 1939. McDowell is a law graduate of The University of Texas, and is now Chief Counsel for the T. & P. Railroad and the Southern Division of the Missouri Pacific Railroad.

<H3><a name="0.C-7">JESSE MARION (seventh child)</a></H3>
Jesse Marion is the fifth son and the seventh child of the family. He was born December 24, 1887, and was raised during the time of mustang grapes and hog plum gathering. He was baptized February 19, 1888. His God-Parents were his grandparents, Ole and Christine Bronstad, and the witnesses were Mr. and Mrs. Eli Nelson. He was confirmed June 19, 1904. He was named for Uncle John and Aunt Mary Colwick.
<P>He attended the Harmony school, and incidentally has the record of having the following contacts with Harmony: he was a pupil, a teacher there, a trustee, and a patron, his two sons attended there. He is a graduate of Clifton Lutheran College. He attended teacher training Summer Normal schools at Meridian and at Baylor University, Waco, Texas, and attended Lutheran Normal School in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. While attending I. N. S. in Sioux Falls, he took a nasty fall while ice skating and sustained an injury which hurt him severely.</p>
<P>An incident that added a little zest to our farm life occurred one day when Jess showed us how people would catch ostrich. You see, our neighbor's turkeys would often feed about our pens and lots. So we fixed up an instrument a light rope about six feet long with a light weight attached at each end. When such an instrument is properly thrown at an ostrich, it will wrap around the bird's legs and thus tie it up. This Jess was going to do with the visiting gobbler. We got the gobbler alright, but the rope wrapped around the bird's neck. It fluttered and squirmed until released. So we didn't have the turkey dinner anyway.</p>
<P>He entered school teaching, and followed this profession for a number of years. His first school was at Kimball, located on the Brazos river in the north part of Bosque County. They needed a man to handle this school, and so the County School Superintendent picked Jess to do this job and he did. Other schools he taught were Live Oak, Norse, Cayote, Harmony, Mustang, and Womack. Also he was a student-teacher at Clifton Lutheran College one year. He also farmed for some years. He farmed a part, of the home farm, farmed in Hamilton County, and then lived for a number of years in the Turkey Creek community. Then in 1966 they moved into Clifton and lived in their home at 307 North Avenue J.</p>
<P>Jesse was married June 30, 1920 to Julia Helen Rea, at Pottsville, Texas. Two sons were born to them: Rea Christian and David Albert. </p>
<H4><a name="0.C-7.A">Rea Christian (grandchild)</a></H4> was born August 1, 1921, Clifton, Texas. Rea died April 3, 1940 while he was a senior student at Clifton Junior College, dying suddenly while he was engaged in campus sports activity.
<H4><a name="0.C-7.B">David Albert (grandchild)</a></H4> was born September 21, 1924, Clifton, Texas. He is a graduate of Clifton Junior College, and he attended Luther College in Decorah, Iowa. He was married July 29, 1950 in Dallas, Texas, to Joan Elizabeth Kerr. Joan is a registered nurse. David and Joan have two daughters, Patricia Ruth and Julie Ann, both are High School students in Garland, Texas. Patricia Ruth was born in Dallas, July 14, 1952, and Julie Ann was born in Dallas, February 17, 1956. They live at 3600 Chicosa Trail, Garland, Texas 75040.
<P>In World War I Jesse entered military service in September 1917, going to Camp Travis, San Antonio, Texas in the very first Selective Service group from Bosque County. After induction, he was sent to Camp Bowie in Ft. Worth, Texas, and became a Corporal in an Engineering unit of the 36th Division. In 1918, his Division was sent to France where he saw active service in combat in <a href= "http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Belleau_Wood"> Ballou Woods [sic]</a> and <a href= "http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Saint-Mihiel"> St. Mihiel.</a> Fortunately, he came back home. He has been an active member of the American Legion almost from its very beginning. If and or when he will, he can tell you just what war is from his own actual experience.</p>
<P><H3><a name="0.C-8">MAY PERNELLA (eighth child)</a></H3>
<p>May Pernella, named for Aunt Margaret (Maggie) Olson and Aunt Pernella Anderson, the third daughter and the eighth child in the family, was born February 17, 1890, and was raised during the time of the wide brimmed, merry widow hats and the high buttoned shoes. She was confirmed June 19, 1904 in the same class with brother Jesse. She was baptized April 6, 1890, and her God-Parents were the grandparents, Ole and Christine Bronstad, and the witnesses were Uncle Syver and Aunt Pernella Anderson.</p>
<P>After her years in the Harmony school, she attended Clifton Lutheran College. She spent some years as saleslady with tho Clifton Mercantile Co., Clifton, Texas. Later she took a business course in Hill Business College, Waco. Thereafter she was employed as Bookkeeper for Freeman Grocery in Waco. Later she was employed in the business office of Goldstein-Migel in Waco, Texas.
Although doing well in the business world, she was not settled or satisfied. Deeply rooted in her nature, there seemed to be a desire for service where she could be active in ministering to people who needed her help. </p>
<P>In response to this apparent call, she, together with her sister Viola and her friend Miss Anna Grimland, entered nursing training in August 1920 at Central Texas Baptist Sanitarium, Waco, Texas. In 1923, she was a member of the third graduating class from that institution. She immediately took up her work as a Registered Nurse, living in the Waco area. From that time and on, to almost her last day of life, she practiced her profession, giving service to such as needed her helping hand. She was devoted to those she served. And she gave of her time and energy and concern to members of her family when occasion a-rose for it. She loved her family dearly. She remained single. </p>
<P>May died in Waco on August 23, 1930 at the age of forty. And, even though her life was comparatively short, we believe her's was a full life, for she gave of herself to her nursing profession in full measure to help those in need of her help and care. She was the first of our family to pass from this life. Her's was a beautiful life. She lies buried in the family plot in the Clifton Cemetery. </p>
<P>May seemed to be always watching over me. In our country school, the teacher, when pupils became unruly, would have them "sit on the stage", up front in the room as a punishment and a means of control. I had been "using" that seat too much and too often, and so as we walked home that day, May made it a point to walk with me. If I walked fast, she walked fast, and if I walked slowly, she walked slowly. She was ashamed of me, you see, and she let me know it. It was effective handling of the case. </p>
<P>Another occasion when May showed her concern over me, and over Jess and Clarence, and all the young men of the community as well, was a meeting held at the Norse Lutheran Church, Sunday afternoon, September 16, 1917, when the Norse, the Clifton, and the Cranfills Gap Lutheran Churches presented a program for the boys going into World War I military service. We were each given a New Testament, Rev. H. W. Estrem was the M. C., and Mrs. Anna Odegaard sang the then new song "Keep the Home Fires Burning". May and I rode home together in a buggy that day. Going home she talked to me about the dangers of war, and how, very likely, some of us would not "come back". It was a rather sobby trip, going home that day. I then fully realized that we were at war. And she was so right.
