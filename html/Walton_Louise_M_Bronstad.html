</p>
   <h2>The Great Depression flails downward, gravitationally drawn to economic bedrock; a young widow with child finds a job closer to her parent's home.</h2>
   <hr>
   <h3> The Clifton Record (a Bosque County, Texas weekly newspaper) recorded the comings and goings in quiet neighboring areas like Cranfills Gap; all the better to increase readership beyond Clifton, TX. I mined microfilm of the Clifton Record for family references. I saw slimmest images of Louise's coming into the social awareness of the Gap, much as one might see, passing a wooden fence, a kinetoscopic view of a neighbor's back yard. Slim little images of her past like:  </h3>
   <h4>1934-09-21</h4>
<p>The Cranfills Gap High School had its formal opening last Monday morning. The devotional exercises were led by Rev. Farmer. Interesting and constructive talks were given by the following: Rev. J. A. Urnes, Mrs. Clara French Richards, Prof. E. B. Harris and Prof. E. P. Christensen. Miss Lurline Linn of Clifton rendered piano solo. The teachers for the school term just opened are as follows: Prof. Chauncy Ford, superintendent; Prof. Thilman Rogstad, coach; Mrs. E. B. Harris, English Mr. Charles Romine, principal of the grammar grades; Mr. Oran Knudson, Mrs. <b>Louise Holbrook</b> and Miss Johnnie Broyles, teachers in the grammar grades. . .</p>

<blockquote class="gwb"> The first Clifton Record mention of Mother is in conjunction with 'Brother Farmer' whom I knew only in Mother's frequent references to him. Put simply, the demands of propriety for a young widow and school teacher were met by boarding with the Methodist minister and his wife.<br>
<br>Bob, who would have been age 2 at this time, remembered Brother Farmer; likely reliable memories happened at a later age. </blockquote>

<h4>1935-02-01</h4>
<p>The Sociology, Home Economics and Civics classes are going to Dallas and Fort Worth this week-end. They are planning to visit several factories and plants, and will be special guests of the Ford Motor Company in Dallas Saturday. Mr. and Mrs. Ford, Mrs. Harris, Mr. Knudson, Miss Broyles and <b>Mrs. Holbrook</b> are the teachers who are going. We are taking both buses for transportation.</p>
<blockquote class="gwb">This is a rural school, busing is important to bring school children from miles around in all directions; in 1935 Cranfills Gap made do with two buses. </blockquote>

<h4>1935-02-22</h4>
<p>Miss Broyles’ room had a Valentine party last Thursday afternoon together with <b>Mrs. Holbrook</b>’s room The visitors were <b>Bobby Holbrook</b> and Ray Miller.
</p>
<h4>1935-05-03</h4>
<p><b>Mrs. Holbrook</b>’s and Miss Broyle’s pupils went on an Easter egg hunt the Thursday before Easter. There were also three visitors: <b>Bobby Holbrook</b>, Beverly Harris and Fred Finstad . . . 
</p>
<h4>1935-08-23</h4>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Binous Tindall, Rev. and Mrs. J. D. Farmer and family, Mrs. <b>Louise Holbrook</b> and son, <b>Bobby</b> and Mr. <b><a href="Bronstad_Clyde_P.html" target="_blank">Clyde Bronstad</a></b> are fishing on the Llano River this week. . . . 
</p>
<blockquote class="gwb">So it seems my Father is courting my Mother; Mother has multiple chaperones along to insure every appearance of propriety. After all, she could not bring the river to the parsonage. This event may be the one recorded in a photograph of <a href="0P-ClydeBPics.html#ClydeLouiseandBobby" target="_blank">Clyde, Louise and <b>Bobby</b>.</a> Or it may be the similar event a year later.<br><br>
Mr. and Mrs. Binous Tindall became lifelong family friends. Both Binous and Myrle were pillars of the Cranfills Gap Methodist Church.</blockquote>
<h4>1935-10-25</h4>
<p>Tuesday, October 22, <b>Mrs. Louise Holbrook</b>, teacher of the third and fourth grades, had charge of the program. It was a miscellaneous program, consisting of songs, readings and selections by the rhythm band.. This program was climaxed by a talk and interspersed with piano numbers of various types by the visiting Methodist evangelist, Rev. James V. Reed. Among the visitors at the assembly were Mmes. Bernt Bertelsen, Milton Stevens, Otto Witte, Charley Johnson, George Oglesby, Mason, Farmer, Miss Willie Mae Wallace, Rev. Farmer and Rev. Reed. 
<blockquote class="gwb">
This quite astonishes me, Mother, perhaps under the influence of Brother Farmer, seems to overplay her Methodist hand. It almost looks like she is proselytizing for Methodism in her elementary school class. That might not have gone down well in a community where Lutherans and Baptists predominated. Prudently, she included Lutheran and Baptist adults among the visitors.
</blockquote>
<h4>1935-12-20</h4>
<p>The class in Home Economics staged the play, <u>Such a Night</u> in the High School auditorium last Friday evening. The play was highly amusing and well rendered. <b>Mrs. Louise Holbrook</b> directed the play. . . . 
</p>
<blockquote class="gwb">
"Other duties as assigned". Little room for specialists in rural schools, one must fill many r&ocirc;les.
</blockquote>
<h4>1936-01-24</h4>
<p>
</p>The Home Economics girls began studying Child Care last week. On the days that we are supposed to have laboratory lessons, we observe children from two to five years old. We study their reactions to certain conditions. We have toys for them to play with; serve them cocoa, and teach them to play group and finger games. The children we observed last week were <b>Bobby Holbrook</b>, Marivone Windham, Mary Nell Rohne, Patsy Lou Grimland and Billie Dunn. . . . 
</p>
<blockquote class="gwb">
<a href="Holbrook_Winnon_G(Bob).html" target="_blank">Bobby</a> is getting a lot of exposure to school settings; that may have helped him develop the exceptional social skills he demonstrated later in life. Louise was lucky that the little rural school district would permit the 3 year old in school. <br>I'm sure Mrs Farmer could not devote all her attention to <b>Bobby</b>; Mother must have found childcare a dificult problem.
</blockquote>
<h4>1936-01-31</h4>
<p>G. O. Bronstad Sr. is recuperating after a two weeks’ illness. . . .</p><br>
<p>Mrs. <b>Louise Holbrook</b>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> grade teacher in the public schools here went to Austin in business the first of this week
</p>
<h4>1936-03-20</h4>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Binous Tindall, <b>Mrs. Louise Holbrook</b> and <b>Mr. Clyde Bronstad</b> attended the Fort Worth Stock Show in Fort Worth Sunday.
</p>
<blockquote class="gwb">
Fewer chaperones suggest Louise is more at ease with Clyde. Then too, the community may have grown a bit jaded with their courtship for the Clifton Record to have invested any more text to them.
</blockquote>
<h4>1936-04-10</h4>
<p>The physics class went to Dallas last Friday on a field trip. They went through the Brown Cracker and Candy Co., WFAA studio, Ford Plant, Dallas News, and Dallas Cotton Mills, <a href="Bronstad_Homer_H.html" target="_blank">Mr. Bronstad</a> and <b>Mrs. Holbrook</b> accompanied them. . . . . <b>Mrs. [Travis] Bronstad</b> taught school last Friday while <b>Mrs. Holbrook</b> was in Dallas.
</p>
<h4>1936-04-17</h4>
<p><b>Mrs. Holbrook</b>’s room and Miss Romine’s room went on an Easter egg hunt last Thursday afternoon. After the hunt they all had all the ice cream they could eat and then played ball.
</p>
<h4>1936-07-24</h4>

They are now at home in Cranfills Gap, where Mr. Bronstad is successfully engaged in the grocery business. At present they are occupying apartments in the Meeks home, but Mr. Bronstad plans to build a beautiful new home in the near future.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Bronstad</b>, the former Miss Louise Walton of Hamilton, is a memeber of the faculty of the Cranfills Gap public school, one of the best institutons in this section of the state. She entered the school last year as a teacher and was re-elected. She is highly educated, being a graduate of the North Texas State Teachers College and well trained for her work, and is universally popular in Cranfills gap and surrounding country. she is gracious in manner, and is attractively accomplished and is a charming addition to Cranfills gap society circles.</p>

<h4>1936-09-25</h4>
<p>The Cranfills Gap Public School opened Monday, September 21. A large number of patrons and friends were present for the opening exercises which consisted of:
<ul>
<li>Invocation - Rev. Farmer.</li>
<li>Male quartet - Messrs. B. C. Colwick, W. J. Maakestad, M. J. Bertelson and A. G. Grimland.</li>
<li>Talk - Rev. Maakestad.</li>
<li>Piano Duet_Mmes. Swenson and Pendleton.</li>
<li>Remarks - Supt. Bronstad.</li>
<li>Remarks - Mr C. O. Sorenson.</li>
<li>Tap Number - Geraldine Pendleton</li>
<li>Talk - Mrs. Clara F. Richards.</li>

</ul></p>
<p>The speakers stressed the many favorable changes that have been made since last school term, namely: Three additional credits in affiliation, on in each of Home Economics I, Mechanical Drawing, and Ancient History, making a total of fifteen affiliated credits. One addition has been made to the faculty - Miss Geraldine Rowe. Four subjects are taught which were not offered last year: Home Economics II, Junior Business Training, Shop and General Mathematics. The greatest visible change, however, is the addition of a new Home Economics laboratory, a class room, and a superintendant's office.</p>
<p>With these improvements, the Cranfills gap School has the most favorable set-up in its history. This should be both gratifying and encouraging to pupils, faculty, and the community in general</p>
<p>The members of the faculty, each specialized in his or her respective field are: Miss Ruby Romine, primary work; Miss Geraldine Rowe, 3rd and 4th grades; Charles Romine, 6th grade and departmental work; Ira Dahl, 7th grade and high school history; <b>Mrs. Clyde Bronstad</b>, Home Economics Junior Business and departmental work; Mrs. E. B. Harris, high school English; Parks Windham, Shop, Mechanical Drawing, civics and general sciences; Homer Bronstad, high school mathematics.</p>
<blockquote class="gwb">
Mother learned Home Economics in college, she chose that college major largely because she was so ill prepared in her birth family. It was her personal lacuna in her concept of a woman's r&ocirc;le. <br><br>
Her Mother, Ethel Walton, was ill prepared for household management because Ethel, her Father's oldest child, was needed for animal husbandry chores; James Monroe Embrey raised sheep for his living. As a wife, Ethel did her best keeping a home, but she was not the best homemaking example. Like Ethel, Louise as a child did her share of outside farm work, her older sisters, Aubrey and Annie, doing more inside chores. While Mother learned homemaking in College from a technical perspective, it was not an arena that interested her; she much preferred teaching fourth grade. For her, it was a sweet spot where children were still obedient and eager to learn. But in a school of limited faculty numbers, you are called on to fit in where needed.
</blockquote>
<p>The initial enrollment in the grammar school is 116 and in the high school 68, making a total of 184. Many students are yet expected to enroll.</p>
<p>The football squad under the able direction of Coach Romine, were out for their first work-out Monday afternoon. Most of these boys recently attended a four-day football training camp on Meridian Creek.</p><br>
<p>Mr. G. O. Bronstad is seriously ill. We trust we will be able to report much improvement in his condition at the next writing.</p>
<blockquote class="gwb">Now a member of the extended Bronstad family, Louise took her turn tending to the ailing family patriarch, <a href="Bronstad_Gulbrand_O.html" target="_blank">Gulbrand</a>. At some point in his decline a stroke must have interfered with his ability to swallow; Mother recalled removing accumulated mucus from Gulbrand's mouth to comfort his breathing.</blockquote>
<p><b>Mrs. Clyde Bronstad</b> was absent from school last Friday afternoon because of illness.
</p>
<h4>1937-03-26</h4>
<p>Pupils are glad to see <b>Mrs. Bronstad</b> back in school after her illness. Miss Burma Wood taught in her place.
</p>
<h4>1937-08-27</h4>
<p>Arrangements are rapidly being completed to open the doors of Cranfills Gap school Monday, August 30, to the largest enrollment in its history. This will be the first term that boys and girls of that section are to be offered a fully accredited high school convenient to them. The fact that all neighboring communities are to be represented in the student body is an indication that this school is accepted as a logical rural high school center for this section. The co-operating of all districts concerned is doing much to build a high school which will be among the best in the state.</p>
<p>Two new courses are to be offered this year. Bookkeeping will be taught to seniors and World History will be taught in the ninth grade.</p>
<p>The faculty for the year consists of the following: Superintendent and teacher of Mathematics, Homer Bronstad; Principal of high school and teacher of industrial work, Parks Windham; English, Mrs. E. B. Harris; Home Making and Business, <b>Mrs. Clyde Bronstad</b>; Principal of Grammar School and teacher of history, Ira Dahl; Coach of Boys' Athletics and teacher of seventh grade, A. J. Bailey; fifth and sixth grade teacher, J. Ludwich; third and fourth grade teacher, Miss Geraldine Rowe; teacher of primary grades, Miss Ruby Romine. . . 
</p>
<h4>1937-09-03</h4>
<p>[at the opening of the C G school] Invocation, Rev J. D. Farmer; vocal duet, <b>Mrs. C. P. Bronstad</b> and Miss Walton; welcome address, Supt. Homer Bronstad; . . . </p>
<blockquote class="gwb">The Miss Walton in the duet with Mother was likely Aunt Aubrey Walton, probably locating her with her parents in Hamilton County at this date. Likely still recuperating from tuberculosis. Conceivably she was angling for a teaching opportunity, for she too, like all her surviving siblings and Mother, Ethel, was a teacher. In a rural setting, there were far fewer models for career opportunities; for women, far fewer models period. 
<br>
All the Walton girls liked to sing and to sing together. A beautiful, trained voice was one of the marks of an accomplished woman.</blockquote>
<h4>1938-04-08</h4>
<p>The first and second year home economics classes made an observation trip to Dallas and Fort Worth last Friday, April 1. They were accompanied by their teacher, <b>Mrs. C. P. Bronstad</b> and Mr. and Mrs. Chris Christenson. The girls who enjoyed this trip were: Myrtice Mygaard, Evelyn Reesing, Minerva Sorley, Jewel Sorley, Hazel Hansen, Virgie Rogstad, Floy Russell, Esther Knudson, Esther Reinhart, Hulene Dittrich, Velda Lee Gaston, Vada McFadden, Mardell Swenson, Ruth Olson, Ruth Schultz, and June Faye Huse. The places visited were: Swift & Co., Baird's Bakery, in Fort Worth and the cotton mills in Dallas. . . . 
</p>
<h4>1938-04-29 </h4>
<p><b>Mrs. Clyde Bronstad</b> was ill the latter part of last week, but is recuperating now.
</p>
<h4>1938-07-15 </h4>
<p><b>Mr. and Mrs. Clyde Bronstad</b> and son, <b>Bobby</b>, have been vacationing and visiting in New Mexico during the past two weeks.
<blockquote class="gwb">Summer in Central Texas is brutal, Clyde's new home was too new to have tree shade. Two hard days drive to the West, lay the mountainous  climate of villages like Cloudcroft or the town of Ruidoso. Though the drive through West Texas and Eastern New Mexico could be hotter, comfort came with the far lower humidity and the cooling blast of lowered car windows rolling at 60 miles per hour down the highway. </blockquote>

<p><b>Mrs. Clyde Bronstad</b> taught high school English during the absence of our teacher, Mrs. E. B. Harris. . . .

{From Wikipedia}<hr> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression" target="_blank">The Great Depression </a> was a severe global economic downturn from 1929 to 1939. The period was characterized by high rates of unemployment and poverty; drastic reductions in liquidity, industrial production, and trade; and widespread bank and business failures around the world. The economic contagion began in 1929 in the United States, the largest economy in the world, with the devastating Wall Street stock market crash of October 1929 often considered the beginning of the Depression. Among the countries with the most unemployed were the U.S., the United Kingdom, and Germany.
<br><br>
The Depression was preceded by a period of industrial growth and social development known as the "Roaring Twenties". Much of the profit generated by the boom was invested in speculation, such as on the stock market, which resulted in growing wealth inequality. Banks were subject to minimal regulation under laissez-faire economic policies, resulting in loose lending and widespread debt. By 1929, declining spending had led to reductions in manufacturing output and rising unemployment. Share values continued to rise until the Wall Street crash, after which the slide continued for three years, accompanied by a loss of confidence in the financial system. By 1933, the unemployment rate in the U.S. had risen to 25 percent, about one-third of farmers had lost their land, and about half of its 25,000 banks had gone out of business. The U.S. federal government under President Herbert Hoover was unwilling to intervene heavily in the economy. In the 1932 presidential election, Hoover was defeated by Franklin D. Roosevelt, who from 1933 pursued a set of expansive New Deal programs in order to provide relief and create jobs. In Germany, which depended heavily on U.S. loans, the crisis caused unemployment to rise to nearly 30% and fueled political extremism, paving the way for Adolf Hitler's Nazi Party to rise to power in 1933.
<br><br>
Between 1929 and 1932, worldwide gross domestic product (GDP) fell by an estimated 15%; in the U.S., the Depression resulted in a 30% contraction in GDP.[1] Recovery varied greatly around the world. Some economies, such as the U.S., Germany and Japan started to recover by the mid-1930s; others, like France, did not return to pre-shock growth rates until later in the decade.[2] The Depression had devastating economic effects on both wealthy and poor countries: all experienced drops in personal income, prices (deflation), tax revenues, and profits. International trade fell by more than 50%, and unemployment in some countries rose as high as 33%.[3] Cities around the world, especially those dependent on heavy industry, were heavily affected. Construction virtually halted in many countries, and farming communities and rural areas suffered as crop prices fell by up to 60%.[4][5][6] Faced with plummeting demand and few job alternatives, areas dependent on primary sector industries suffered the most.[7] The outbreak of World War II in 1939 ended the Depression, as it stimulated factory production, providing jobs for women as militaries absorbed large numbers of young, unemployed men.

In a community like Cranfills Gap, very little went unnoticed. There were no Gestapo or NKVD spies earning their State Security keep, but there were neighbors who wanted to know which kin visited whom and where their neighbors had been the last two days.<br><br>
Such information did not so much stabilize the state as sell the local weeklies, The <u>Clifton Record</u> or the <u>Meridian Tribune</u>. To me, <u>The Clifton Record</u> offered richer ore. There seemed to have been more Norwegian ties between Cranfills gap (the Gap) and Clifton than between the Gap and Meridian.<hr>
<br>
Other expressions of this web of social interest were less beneficial. Religious tension extended into Clyde's home and hobbled household harmony. Louise was a committed Methodist and Clyde was a formally Confirmed Lutheran. Clyde and Louise wed not in Cranfills Gap's St Olaf Lutheran Church, but in a Lutheran Church in Waco. Surely they agreed on mutual acceptance, but the difference continually hampered harmony. Conflicting issues were often decided on the battleground of scriptural quotations. <br><br>
Each, Clyde and Louise, retained their religious affiliation to the end of their lives. They were finally united in their joint graves.

<blockquote class="gwb">
Silk worms were one of Mom's successes. Their life–cycle married the magic of nature with the community of man.
<br><br>
Later, post-war years later, after grandmother died, when Aunt Margaret was left to her own devices in the G. O. - Laura Bronstad home, when Clyde's family moved to and lived in that home, there was, somehow, a mulberry tree just a few yards from the front–porch door.
<br><br>
Other people had them. Si Johnson, father of Mark, had a magnificent, fruitful mulberry in the backyard. It seems they had chickens, a small barn and a cow or cows that grazed the pasture through which a little branch or creek wended.
<br><br>
Up the hill a way from the Johnson's, Past Chris Rohne's house, the Bronstad mulberry was too young to yield much fruit, but the leaves could be fed to the silkworms at school and those domesticated silkworms lived their lives as well for us as for any Asian weaver of silk.
<br><br>
They left behind cocoons of white and yellow and, after metamorphosis and mating, tiny bead rows of eggs that yearned for next year's mulberry leaves.
<br><br>
The mulberry could also be pruned for switches that, once your pants were down, could rip painful red whelps on your leg if ten–year–old–you tried to stretch Mother further than she could go.

Deracination looks hard on these folks; gasoline rationing should have meant little travel, yet they did travel, keeping family sinews taunt. Workers in the military industry were entitled to 8 gallons of gasoline per week. The round–trip from Bellmead to Cranfills Gap must have cost at least 8 gallons. Clyde still had to get back and forth to Blackland Army Airfield, Louise to Bellmead's LaVega school.
<br><br>
I have a recollection so close to the substance of fiction that I do not recommend the recall as factual; it is surely total fancy. But one wonders, "How do people behave under conditions of 'excessive economic control'?"
<br><br>
Cpt. Shipp must have received his Captaincy (military commission to pay grade O-3), because he was an experienced doctor of medicine. {I'm partial to him because he delivered me.} With that combined status, he was over-qualified for all the gasoline and tires he needed. An X–card.
<br><br>
Do I recall a mission by Clyde, despite Mother's near withering caution, a mission for Clyde to siphon 10 gallons from Dr. Shipp's car's tank to the '36 Ford's tank?
<br><br>
Bronstads, Shipps and Tindalls played cards together in Cranfills Gap. If Clyde took all the risks – by siphoning the gas from Dr. Shipp's car and compensated his friend for the gas he must buy, how could the good doctor deny that?
<br><br>
Could Clyde do that just to visit his mother? I could not respect him if he could not. But then, this is just frail memory and speculation. His resources may have been adequate without ration–scoffing.

<p>Presently the auto trip from Cranfills Gap to Brownwood (Camp Bowie) is 80 miles. In 1940, it was longer. For a brief while, Clyde worked at the PX at Camp Bowie; after WW II broke out, better applications for his skills emerged. </p>
<p>Context </p>
<blockquote class="wiki">
{From Wikipedia}<hr> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Bowie" target="_blank">Camp Bowie</a>, named in honor of the Texas patriot James Bowie, was a military training facility during World War II, and was the third camp in Texas to be so named. From 1940 to 1946, it grew to be one of the largest training centers in Texas.
<br><br>
In 1940, the war situation in Europe caused the United States Congress to determine that the time had arrived to strengthen the defense system. President Franklin D. Roosevelt was handed the power to mobilize the National Guard units. The 36th Division of the Texas National Guard unit arrived at Camp Bowie, located then in Fort Worth, in mid-December for their year's training, but before training was finished, war had been declared.
<br><br>
On September 19, 1940, the War Department announced that a camp would be built at Brownwood, Texas. Work began at the campsite on September 27, 1940. The camp was the first major defense project in the state, with no scarcity of labor when the building work began.
<br><br>
In 1943, the first German prisoners of war arrived; many were members of Erwin Rommel's Afrika Corps.[1] The 2,700 men worked as day laborers for the farms in central Texas.
<br><br>
On August 1, 1946, the War Department notified Texas members of Congress that the camp had been declared "surplus." The Civilian War Assets Administration was to take charge and began the distribution of the land and buildings.

<p>In a deal that was consummated Tuesday of this week, Mr. E. A. Thompson of Hico sold his farm adjoining town to Mr. R. O. Blum, formerly being the Mrs. M. J. Mickelson place. </p>
<blockquote class=" gwb ">Clyde and family lived in the Blum house 1945–1947; it was wonderfully spacious, having more rooms than we could purpose. One or more upstairs rooms was locked, securing others' property, there was a sewing room in which very little was sewn.
<br><br>
In that house, I was first aware of being ill, spending nights on an Army surplus folding cot in the kitchen. Perhaps for warmth, perhaps for medicated steam. In that house, Bob suffered mumps in his adolescence: Dick and I were sternly warned to keep our distance, both to avoid disease and to avoid the wrath of an inexplicably testy Bob. In that house, new–born Bette came home as an infant, separating me from a Mother's attention.
<br><br>
In that house, for the better part of the summer, I owned Mother, all to my own, for Clyde and Bob were away in Kansas and states further North, earning money on wheat harvesting crew.
<br><br>
In that house, Mother taught me love of the pussy–willow catkins bulging day by day in spring warmth, until the slough of spring hail surrounded the house and shocked the pussy–willow into pause.

In that house, I now think, I witnessed a Mother making her nest for her new chick.

For an 11 year old, it was apocalyptic in the original Greek sense of opening a curtain. Not simply the urban advantage over the rural, it was a Dallas exulting over things that were not and were never to be. Big Tex was not simply a statue, he wore fabric clothes like a real human. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Ling" target="_blank">James Joseph "Jimmy" Ling</a> sold corporate stock in an impossible dream at a his booth.

&nbsp; &nbsp; It was special, singing at the piano with Grandma, Grandpa and Bette.<br> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; Bette told me that the crawl space was haunted. That terrified me.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I would go to church with them; Breakfast with them; waffles in the kitchen. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I remember the back bed room; it was all so special.
