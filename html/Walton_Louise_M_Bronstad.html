   <h3> The Clifton Record (a Bosque County, Texas weekly newspaper) recorded the comings and goings in quiet neighboring areas like Cranfills Gap; all the better to increase readership beyond Clifton, TX. I mined microfilm of the Clifton Record for family references. I saw slimmest images of Louise's coming into the social awareness of the Gap, much as one might see, passing a wooden fence, a kinetoscopic view of a neighbors back yard. Slim little images like:  </h3>
   <h4>1934-09-21</h4>
<p>The Cranfills Gap High School had its formal opening last Monday morning. The devotional exercises were led by Rev. Farmer. Interesting and constructive talks were given by the following: Rev. J. A. Urnes, Mrs. Clara French Richards, Prof. E. B. Harris and Prof. E. P. Christensen. Miss Lurline Linn of Clifton rendered piano solo. The teachers for the school term just opened are as follows: Prof. Chauncy Ford, superintendent; Prof. Thilman Rogstad, coach; Mrs. E. B. Harris, English Mr. Charles Romine, principal of the grammar grades; Mr. Oran Knudson, Mrs. <b>Louise Holbrook</b> and Miss Johnnie Broyles, teachers in the grammar grades. . .</p>

<blockquote class="gwb"> The first Clifton Record mention of Mother is in conjunction with 'Brother Farmer' whom I knew only in Mother's frequent memories of him. Put simply, the demands of propriety for a young widow and school teacher were met by boarding with the Methodist minister and his wife.<br>
<br>Bob who would have been age 2 at this time, remembered Brother Farmer; likely reliable memories happened at a later age. </blockquote>

<h4>1936-09-25</h4>
<p>The Cranfills Gap Public School opened Monday, September 21. A large number of patrons and friends were present for the opening exercises which consisted of:
<ul>
<li>Invocation - Rev. Farmer.</li>
<li>Male quartet - Messrs. B. C. Colwick, W. J. Maakestad, M. J. Bertelson and A. G. Grimland.</li>
<li>Talk - Rev. Maakestad.</li>

<li>Remarks - Mr C. O. Sorenson.</li>
<li>Tap Number - Geraldine Pendleton</li>
<li>Talk - Mrs. Clara F. Richards.</li>

</ul></p>
<p>The speakers stressed the many favorable changes that have been made since last school term, namely: Three additional credits in affiliation, on in each of Home Economics I, Mechanical Drawing, and Ancient History, making a total of fifteen affiliated credits. One addition has been made to the faculty - Miss Geraldine Rowe. Four subjects are taught which were not offered last year: Home Economics II, Junior Business Training, Shop and General Mathematics. The greatest visible change, however, is the addition of a new Home Economics laboratory, a class room, and a superintendant's office.</p>
<p>With these improvements, the Cranfills gap School has the most favorable set-up in its history. This should be both gratifying and encouraging to pupils, faculty, and the community in general</p>
<p>The members of the faculty, each specialized in his or her respective field are: Miss Ruby Romine, primary work; Miss Geraldine Rowe, 3rd and 4th grades; Charles Romine, 6th grade and departmental work; Ira Dahl, 7th grade and high school history; Mrs. <b>Clyde Bronstad</b>, Home Economics Junior Business and departmental work; Mrs. E. B. Harris, high school English; Parks Windham, Shop, Mechanical Drawing, civics and general sciences; Homer Bronstad, high school mathematics.</p>

<p>Arrangements are rapidly being completed to open the doors of Cranfills Gap school Monday, August 30, to the largest enrollment in its history. This will be the first term that boys and girls of that section are to be offered a fully accredited high school convenient to them. The fact that all neighboring communities are to be represented in the student body is an indication that this school is accepted as a logical rural high school center for this section. The co-operating of all districts concerned is doing much to build a high school which will be among the best in the state.</p>
<p>Two new courses are to be offered this year. Bookkeeping will be taught to seniors and World History will be Tibet in the ninth grade.</p>
<p>The faculty for the year consists of the following: Superintendent and teacher of Mathematics, Homer Bronstad; Principal of high school and teacher of industrial work, Parks Windham; English, Mrs. E.

<p>In a community like Cranfills Gap, very little went unnoticed. There were no Gestapo or NKVD spies earning their State Secutity keep, but there were neighbors who wanted to know which kin visited whom and where their neighbors had been the last two days. Such information did not so much stabilize the state as sell the local weeklies, The <u>Clifton Record</u> or the <u>Meridian Tribune</u>. To me, <u>The Clifton Record</u> offered richer ore. There seemed to have been more Norwegian ties between Cranfills gap (the Gap) and Clifton than beween the Gap and Meridian.</p>

<p>. . . We are sorry that Mr. Ellingson, a teacher, is ill and cannot be with us. Mrs. <b>Clyde Bronstad</b> is teaching in his place while he is ill.

<p>Mrs. Bronstad taught the fifth grade Tuesday of this week. We were glad when Mr. Ellingson came back.

<blockquote class="gwb"> In many cases these Clifton Record excerpts reflect the authorship of school scribes. They are probably more intent in pleasing their teacher than considering the feelings of the substitute teacher. </blockquote>

<p>On Tuesday morning, September 24, a son was born to Mr. and Mrs. <b>Clyde Bronstad</b>. He has been named Gilbert Walton and is a fine, healthy child, He and his mother are reported to be doing nicely.

<p>Mr. and Mrs. <b>Clyde Bronstad</b> and son Bobby, were business visitors in Waco Monday.

<h4>1942-03-20</h4>
<p>Mrs <b>Clyde Bronstad</b> has accepted the principalship of the Eulogy school, left vacant by the resignation of Mr. Lewis Powers, who has accepted employment in Waco.
</p>
<blockquote class="gwb">This, "accepted the principalship" phrase so arrested my attention because I don't remember 'school principal' being part of Mother's curriculum vitae. I visited Eulogy, Texas [close by Glen Rose and Walnut Springs, TX] some year in the prior millenium. Watched in my mind and could not resurrect enough of Eulogy to now think a principalship there useful to one's Vita.
<br><br>
Bundle that percept with the image of Mother plying 1942 back roads of Bosque County. These were far more primitive than you could imagine now. The round-trip Gap–Eulogy–Gap was about 90 miles.

<p>Mr. and Mrs. <b>Clyde Bronstad</b> and sons, Bobby and Walton, and Miss Marguerite Bronstad were business visitors in Fort Worth Saturday.
</p>
<blockquote class="gwb">This may indeed have been for business. After the death of her first husband, Marshall Holbrook in 1933, Mother, daughter of a farmer, ploughed some of Marshall's life–insurance money into a modest Fort Worth rental property as a surety for their son, Bob.
<br><br>
War work has Clyde in a more urban locale; he will have investigated the cost of rental property to relocate his family. The economics of massive war location will have chased rental prices to heights frightening for rural folk. Clyde and Louise will have responded wanting competetive rents for their Fort Worth property.
<br><br>

<br><br>The fifth and sixth grades are very glad that Mrs. Bronstad brought her silkworms to school..</p>
<blockquote class="gwb">
Silk worms were one of Mom's successes. Their life–cycle married the magic of nature with the community of man.
<br><br>
Later, post-war years later, after grandmother died, when Aunt Margaret was left to her own devices in the G. O. - Laura Bronstad home, when Clyde's family moved to and lived in that home, there was, somehow, a mulberry tree just a few yards from the front–porch door.
<br><br>
Other people had them. Si Johnson, father of Mark, had a magnificent, fruitful mulberry in the back yard. It seems they had chickens, a small barn and a cow or cows that grazed the pasture through which a little branch or creek wended.
<br><br>
Up the hill a way from the Johnson's, Past Chris Rohne's house, the Bronstad mulberry was too young to yield much fruit, but the leaves could be fed to the silkworms at school and those domesticated silkworms lived their lives as well for us as for any Asian weaver of silk.
<br><br>
They left behind cocoons of white and yellow and, after metamorphosis and mating, tiny bead rows of eggs that yearned for next year's mulberry leaves.
<br><br>
The mulberry could also be pruned for switches that, once your pants were down, could rip painful red whelps on your leg if ten–year–old–you tried to stretch Mother further than she could go.

<blockquote class="gwb">
Deracination looks hard on these folks; gasoline rationing should have meant little travel, yet they did travel, keeping family sinews taunt. Workers in the military industry were entitled to 8 gallons of gasoline per week. The round–trip from Bellmead to Cranfills Gap must have cost at least 8 gallons. Clyde still had to get back and forth to Blackland Army Airfield, Louise to Bellmead's LaVega school.
<br><br>
I have a recollection so close to the substance of fiction that I do not recommend the recall as factual; it is surely total fancy. But one wonders, "How do peole behave under conditions of 'excessive economic control?'"
<br><br>
Cpt. Shipp must have received his Captaincy (military commision to pay grade O-3,) because he was an experienced doctor of medicine. {I'm partial to him because he delivered me.} With that combined status he was over-qualified for all the gasoline and tires he needed. An X–card.
<br><br>
Do I recall a mission by Clyde, despite Mother's near withering caution, a mission for Clyde to siphon 10 gallons from Dr. Shipp's car's tank to the '36 Ford's tank?
<br><br>
Bronstads, Shipps and Tindalls played cards together in Cranfills Gap. If Clyde took all the risks – by siphoning the gas from Dr. Shipp's car and compensated his friend for the gas he must buy, how could the good doctor deny that?
<br><br>
Could Clyde do that just to visit his mother? I could not respect him if he could not. But then, this is just frail memory and speculation. His resources may have been adequate without ration–scoffing.

<blockquote class=" gwb ">Clyde and family lived in the Blum house 1945–1947; it was wonderfully spacious, having more rooms than we could purpose. One or more upstairs rooms was locked, securing others' property, there was a sewing room in which very little was sewn.
<br><br>
In that house, I was first aware of being ill, spending nights on an Army surplus folding cot in the kitchen. Perhaps for warmth, perhaps for medicated steam. In that house, Bob suffered mumps in his adolescence: Dick and I were sternly warned to keep our distance, both to avoid disease and to avoid the wrath of an inexplicably testy Bob. In that house, new–born Bette came home as an infant, separating me from a Mother's attention.
<br><br>
In that house, for the better part of the summer, I owned Mother, all to my own, for Clyde and Bob were away in Kansas and states further North, earning money on wheat harvesting crew.
<br><br>
In that house, Mother taught me love of the pussy–willow catkins bulging day by day in spring warmth, until the slough of spring hail surrounded the house and shocked the pussy–willow into pause.
<br><br>
In that house, I now think, I witnessed a Mother making her nest for her new chick.

<blockquote class="gwb"> More reading between the lines. More putting two plus two together and risking the result be 222. But the sequence of events - Clyde losing his partner, Uncle Homer, Clyde's speculating on housing in Cranfills Gap, of all inauspicious places for spec housing, and the prospects of a partnership with Barton Peterson, in union with visits with his brother–in–law, Sam Hudson Walton, who had grown wealthy with his spudder during wartime need for oil, might be willing to make a familial loan to his brother–in–law suggests. It was not a good time for travelling in North Texas with one's family.

In my childhood memory of that winter–return from the visit to Witchita Falls, Texas, freezing rain chased us home much of the way from North to Central Texas. As to the loan, whether fictitious, fruitful or frustrated, the Clyde Bronstad–Barton Peterson partnership worked for a brief while. Worked until the economic absurdity of four grocers vieing for a living in rural, declining Cranfills Gap dictated that any with better outside purchase ought to leave. And unhappily leave, Clyde, years later would.
