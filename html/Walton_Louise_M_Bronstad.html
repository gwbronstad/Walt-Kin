Harris, English Mr. Charles Romine, principal of the grammar grades; Mr. Oran Knudson, Mrs. Louise Holbrook and Miss Johnnie Broyles, teachers in the grammar grades. . .</p>

<blockquote class="gwb"> The first Clifton Record memtion of Mother is in conjunction with 'Brother Farmer' whom I knew only in Mother's frequent reference to him. Put simply, the demands of propriety for a young widow and school teacher were met by boarding with the Methodist minister and his wife.<br>
<br>Bob who would have been age 2 at this time, remembered Brother Farmer; likely reliable memories happened at a later age. </blockquote>

<p>The Cranfills Gap Public School opened Monday, September 21. A large number of patrons and friends were present for the opening exercises which consisted of:
<ul>
<li>Invocation - Rev. Farmer.</li>
<li>Male quartet - Messrs. B. C. Colwick, W. J. Maakestad, M. J. Bertelson and A. G. Grimland.</li>

<li>Remarks - Mr C. O. Sorenson.</li>
<li>Tap Number - Geraldine Pendleton</li>
<li>Talk - Mrs. Clara F. Richards.</li>

</ul></p>
<p>The speakers stressed the many favorable changes that have been made since last school term, namely: Three additional credits in affiliation, on in each of Home Economics I, Mechanical Drawing, and Ancient History, making a total of fifteen affiliated credits. One addition has been made to the faculty - Miss Geraldine Rowe. Four subjects are taught which were not offered last year: Home Economics II, Junior Business Training, Shop and General Mathematics. The greatest visible change, however, is the addition of a new Home Economics laboratory, a class room, and a superintendant's office.</p>
<p>With these improvements, the Cranfills gap School has the most favorable set-up in its history. This should be both gratifying and encouraging to pupils, faculty, and the community in general</p>

<p>Arrangements are rapidly being completed to open the doors of Cranfills Gap school Monday, August 30, to the largest enrollment in its history. This will be the first term that boys and girls of that section are to be offered a fully accredited high school convenient to them. The fact that all neighboring communities are to be represented in the student body is an indication that this school is accepted as a logical rural high school center for this section. The co-operating of all districts concerned is doing much to build a high school which will be among the best in the state.</p>
<p>Two new courses are to be offered this year. Bookkeeping will be taught to seniors and World History will be Tibet in the ninth grade.</p>
<p>The faculty for the year consists of the following: Superintendent and teacher of Mathematics, Homer Bronstad; Principal of high school and teacher of industrial work, Parks Windham; English, Mrs. E.

<blockquote class="gwb">This may indeed have been for business. After the death of her first husband, Marshall Holbrook in 1933, Mother, daughter of a farmer, ploughed some of Marshall's life–insurance money into a modest Fort Worth rental property as a surety for their son, Bob.
<br><br>
War work has Clyde in a more urban locale; he will have investigated the cost of rental property to relocate his family. The economics of massive war location will have chased rental prices to heights frightening for rural folk. Clyde and Louise will have responded wanting competetive rents for their Fort Worth property.

Most likely, they would have relied on Uncle Embrey Walton, long time resident of Fort Worth, to look after their interest as rental agent. </blockquote>

<br><br>The fifth and sixth grades are very glad that Mrs. Bronstad brought her silkworms to school..</p>
<blockquote class="gwb">
Silk worms were one of Mom's successes. Their life–cycle married the magic of nature with the community of man.
<br><br>
Later, post-war years later, after grandmother died, when Aunt Margaret was left to her own devices in the G. O. - Laura Bronstad home, when Clyde's family moved to and lived in that home, there was, somehow, a mulberry tree just a few yards from the front–porch door.
<br><br>
Other people had them. Si Johnson, father of Mark, had a magnificent, fruitful mulberry in the back yard. It seems they had chickens, a small barn and a cow or cows that grazed the pasture through which a little branch or creek wended.
<br><br>
Up the hill a way from the Johnson's, Past Chris Rohne's house, the Bronstad mulberry was too young to yield much fruit, but the leaves could be fed to the silkworms at school and those domesticated silkworms lived their lives as well for us as for any Asian weaver of silk.
<br><br>
They left behind cocoons of white and yellow and, after metamorphosis and mating, tiny bead rows of eggs that yearned for next year's mulberry leaves.
<br><br>
The mulberry could also be pruned for switches that, once your pants were down, could rip painful red whelps on your leg if ten–year–old–you tried to stretch Mother further than she could go.

<p>Mrs. J. R. Shipp and children recently of San Antonio, and Mrs.<b>Clyde Bronstad</b>  and sons of Bell Mead were here Tuesday visiting relatives and friends.</p>
<blockquote class="gwb">
Deracination looks hard on these folks; gasoline rationing should have meant little travel, yet they did travel, keeping family sinews taunt. Workers in the military industry were entitled to 8 gallons of gasoline per week. The round–trip from Bellmead to Cranfills Gap must have cost at least 8 gallons. Clyde still had to get back and forth to Blackland Army Airfield, Louise to Bellmead's LaVega school.
<br><br>
I have a recollection so close to the substance of fiction that I do not recommend the recall as factual; it is surely total fancy. But one wonders, "How do peole behave under conditions of 'excessive economic control?'"
<br><br>
Cpt. Shipp must have received his Captaincy (military commision to pay grade O-3,) because he was an experienced doctor of medicine. {I'm partial to him because he delivered me.} With that combined status he was over-qualified for all the gasoline and tires he needed. An X–card.
<br><br>
Do I recall a mission by Clyde, despite Mother's near withering caution, a mission for Clyde to siphon 10 gallons from Dr. Shipp's car's tank to the '36 Ford's tank?
<br><br>
Bronstads, Shipps and Tindalls played cards together in Cranfills Gap. If Clyde took all the risks – by siphoning the gas from Dr. Shipp's car and compensated his friend for the gas he must buy, how could the good doctor deny that?
<br><br>
Could Clyde do that just to visit his mother? I could not respect him if he could not. But then, this is just frail memory and speculation. His resources may have been adequate without ration–scoffing.

<p>In a deal that was consummated Tuesday of this week, Mr. E. A. Thompson of Hico sold his farm adjoining town to Mr. R. O. Blum, formerly being the Mrs. M. J. Mickelson place. </p>
<blockquote class=" gwb ">Clyde and family lived in the Blum house 1945–1947; it was wonderfully spacious, having more rooms than we could purpose. One or more upstairs rooms was locked, securing others' property, there was a sewing room in which very little was sewn.
<br><br>
In that house, I was first aware of being ill, spending nights on an Army surplus folding cot in the kitchen. Perhaps for warmth, perhaps for medicated steam. In that house, Bob suffered mumps in his adolescence: Dick and I were sternly warned to keep our distance, both to avoid disease and to avoid the wrath of an inexplicably testy Bob. In that house, new–born Bette came home as an infant, separating me from a Mother's attention.
<br><br>
In that house, for the better part of the summer, I owned Mother, all to my own, for Clyde and Bob were away in Kansas and states further North, earning money on wheat harvesting crew.
<br><br>
In that house, Mother taught me love of the pussy–willow catkins bulging day by day in spring warmth, until the slough of spring hail surrounded the house and shocked the pussy–willow into pause.
<br><br>
In that house, I now think, I witnessed a Mother making her nest for her new chick.

<blockquote class="gwb"> More reading between the lines. More putting two plus two together and risking the result be 222. But the sequence of events - Clyde losing his partner, Uncle Homer, Clyde's speculating on housing in Cranfills Gap, of all inauspicious places for spec housing, and the prospects of a partnership with Barton Peterson, in union with visits with his brother–in–law, Sam Hudson Walton, who had grown wealthy with his spudder during wartime need for oil, might be willing to make a familial loan to his brother–in–law suggests. It was not a good time for travelling in North Texas with one's family.

In my childhood memory of that winter–return from the visit to Witchita Falls, Texas, freezing rain chased us home much of the way from North to Central Texas. As to the loan, whether fictitious, fruitful or frustrated, the Clyde Bronstad–Barton Peterson partnership worked for a brief while. Worked until the economic absurdity of four grocers vieing for a living in rural, declining Cranfills Gap dictated that any with better outside purchase ought to leave. And unhappily leave, Clyde, years later would. 
</blockquote>
<h4>1948-01-23</h4>
<p>Mr. Clyde Bronstad and Mr. Barton Pederson formed a partnership grocery business Monday in purchasing the Clarence Johnson grocery.
</p>
<blockquote class="gwb">The store was in the same building that Clydes Father, Gulbrand, had built. Field limestone walls topped with a flat, roof inclined toward the rear entrance. The front two-thirds began with two display window and a front double screen door. The windows might display perishable fruit like banannas or apples. Sometimes trace inducement schemes were displayed. A given amount of purchases might entitle one to a china plate or a gravy boat. The floors were pine, darkened from decades of sweeping the floors with a mixture of sawdust and kerosene after closing. There were 2 soda pop coolers, chilled with ice and an ice cream cabinet chilled with mechanical refrigeration. A cylindrical copper fire extinguisher hung on the West wall. Front center had an island with cabinets holding cigarettes and other tobacco products. Atop the island, a large cash register commanded commerce. Wooden display cabinets held containters of staples like baking powder or steel canned vegetable or fruit products. Tansverse in the rear of the sales area was a chilled cabinet for displaying cuts of meat. Behind that a butcher's block and a slicing machine. This was mostly Clyde's domain; one of the skills he picked-up was butchering.
