<h4><a id="FredDeath"></a>1915-05-14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Child [Frederick Walton] Meets Tragic Death </h4>
<p> An accident which resulted in the instant death of Frederick Walton the little five year old son of Mr. and Mrs. Will Walton of Blue Ridge, occurred Wednesday afternoon at about 3:30 o'clock near the residence of W. O. O'Bannon, four miles from Hamilton.
<br><br>
The little boy was riding in a wagon in which his uncle, Tom Walton, was hauling a hay press. The child was standing near the press, when an upright lever caught in a low telephone wire, toppling over the press. It is supposed the child jumped from the wagon, the press falling out of the wagon on him, crushing him to death instantly.--<u>Hamilton Herald</u>. </p>
<blockquote class="Cy2"><img class="ndx" src="../pic/Pinky/Walt-pinky.png" alt="picture Walt Bronstad">&nbsp;&nbsp;Grandfather Will Walton said of Frederick,"We knew Fred was uncommon, he was always pleased with whatever we gave him or did for him. We had expecrted great things of such a disposition, but now he is gone."<br><br>The pain of this loss struck not only parents, siblings, Aunts and Uncles; the pain has become part of the patrimony of the next generation. <br><br>
Mother took care that I, as a child, then later as an adult visited <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/19979160/frederick-cook-walton" target="_blank">Uncle Frederick's grave</a>. (You can visit too, vicariously, by clicking the link.)

<h4>1924-10-03&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <b><u>Hamilton Herald-Record</b></u></h4>
<p> W. T. Walton, one of Hamiltor county's best citizens and a prosperous farmer, was a pleasant business caller in the Herald-Record office last Saturday afternoon. While here he informed us that his daughter, <a href="Walton_Annie_Joy_Walton.html" target="_blank">Miss Annie Walton</a> had returned to John Tarleton College in Stephenville for her last year in that institution. <a href="Walton_Aubrey_Gilkes.html" target="_blank">Miss Aubrey Walton</a>, who graduated from Tarleton last spring, will teach with her brother, <a href="Walton_William_E.html" target="_blank">Prof. Embrey Walton</a>, in the Shive school this year. This family of young folks are ambitious and are attaining to great usefulness in their school work, and a legion of friends wish for their continued success and happiness.</p>
<blockquote class="Cy2"><img class="ndx" src="../pic/Pinky/Walt-pinky.png" alt="picture Walt Bronstad">&nbsp;&nbsp;This man was "bustin his buttons" with Fatherly pride. Wouldn't suffice to simply talk up his children to the fellows on the Hamilton courthouse square, or congenial congregants of his church. Nothing less than the entire literati in the reach of the <u>Hamilton Herald</u> would do. <br><br>
And it <u>was</u> quite an achievement for each sibling; homework hours were sandwiched between farm chores and the limited availability of kerosene lamps and oil for night reading light.<br><br>
And it <u>was</u> an achievement for Will and Ethel who could afford to send each child to school and continue to run the farm with a declining family work force.

<h4>1929-08-08</h4> 	
<p><a href=" https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/details/LYGH-97X " target="_blank">James Claibourne Walton</a>, Louise's double cousin through her uncle Jim, and aunt Florence wed <a href=" https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/details/L21C-YZY" target="_blank"> Mary Leone Patterson</a>. Claibourne had to change church to Church of Christ to close the deal.</p>
<blockquote class="Cy2"><img class="ndx" src="../pic/Pinky/Walt-pinky.png" alt="picture Walt Bronstad">&nbsp;&nbsp;Well after Will's death in 1957, when the land was being divided among the siblings, Mother and I drove on the gravel road within the "ranch", land Will had used to graze cattle. It's an undulating section of land, covered in grass and live oak trees. At the 'top' of the section were rude shelter and feeder troughs. 
<br><br>
WIll would feed the cattle frequently throughout the week; that let him check on his cattle, to see if any were injured or in calf and other such work of herdsmen. The road hugged the fencelines, wherever terrain and live oak clusters permitted, so as to ease the job of checking the fence. 
<br><br>
But that day, Mother crept slower than usual along the rough rutted road, seeking Claibourne's shack. It took Claibourne long, isolated nights of wrestling with his soul before he could find a way to meet Leone's demand to change to her family's church.
<br><br>
At the time, I inferred Claibourne had built a retreat shack, but after having read Grace (Embrey) Eubanks account of James Monroe Embreys settling near Hamilton, " Later there were other small houses done on the ranch near Bear Creek--moving closer to town each time they were built", I now infer Claibourne squatted in an abandoned house/shack.

This quite astonishes me, Mother, perhaps under the influence of Brother Farmer, seems to overplay her Methodist hand.

Prudently, she included Lutheran and Baptist adults among the visitors.

<p>The Cranfills Gap Public School opened Monday, September 21. A large number of patrons and friends were present for the opening exercises which consisted of:

<li>Remarks - Supt. Bronstad.</li>
<li>Remarks - Mr C. O. Sorenson.</li>
<li>Tap Number - Geraldine Pendleton</li>
<li>Talk - Mrs. Clara F. Richards.</li>

</ul></p>
<p>The speakers stressed the many favorable changes that have been made since last school term, namely: Three additional credits in affiliation, on in each of Home Economics I, Mechanical Drawing, and Ancient History, making a total of fifteen affiliated credits. One addition has been made to the faculty - Miss Geraldine Rowe. Four subjects are taught which were not offered last year: Home Economics II, Junior Business Training, Shop and General Mathematics. The greatest visible change, however, is the addition of a new Home Economics laboratory, a class room, and a superintendant's office.</p>
<p>With these improvements, the Cranfills gap School has the most favorable set-up in its history. This should be both gratifying and encouraging to pupils, faculty, and the community in general</p>
<p>The members of the faculty, each specialized in his or her respective field are: Miss Ruby Romine, primary work; Miss Geraldine Rowe, 3rd and 4th grades; Charles Romine, 6th grade and departmental work; Ira Dahl, 7th grade and high school history; <b>Mrs. Clyde Bronstad</b>, Home Economics Junior Business and departmental work; Mrs. E.

Mother learned Home Economics in college, she chose that college major largely because she was so ill prepared in her birth family. It was her personal lacuna in her concept of a woman's r&ocirc;le. <br><br>
Her Mother, Ethel Walton, was ill prepared for household management because Ethel, her Father's oldest child, was needed for animal husbandry chores; James Monroe Embrey raised sheep for his living. As a wife, Ethel did her best keeping a home, but she was not the best homemaking example. Like Ethel, Louise as a child did her share of outside farm work, her older sisters, Aubrey and Annie, doing more inside chores. While Mother learned homemaking in College from a technical perspective, it was not an arena that interested her; she much preferred teaching fourth grade. For her, it was a sweet spot where children were still obedient and eager to learn. But in a school of limited faculty numbers, you are called on to fit in where needed.

<p>Arrangements are rapidly being completed to open the doors of Cranfills Gap school Monday, August 30, to the largest enrollment in its history. This will be the first term that boys and girls of that section are to be offered a fully accredited high school convenient to them. The fact that all neighboring communities are to be represented in the student body is an indication that this school is accepted as a logical rural high school center for this section. The co-operating of all districts concerned is doing much to build a high school which will be among the best in the state.</p>
<p>Two new courses are to be offered this year. Bookkeeping will be taught to seniors and World History will be taught in the ninth grade.</p>
<p>The faculty for the year consists of the following: Superintendent and teacher of Mathematics, Homer Bronstad; Principal of high school and teacher of industrial work, Parks Windham; English, Mrs. E. B. Harris; Home Making and Business, <b>Mrs. Clyde Bronstad</b>; Principal of Grammar School and teacher of history, Ira Dahl; Coach of Boys' Athletics and teacher of seventh grade, A. J.

Likely still recuperating from tuberculosis. Conceivably she was angling for a teaching opportunity, for she too, like all her surviving siblings and Mother, Ethel, was a teacher. In a rural setting, there were far fewer models for career opportunities; for women, far fewer models period.

{From Wikipedia}<hr class="yr"> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression" target="_blank">The Great Depression </a> was a severe global economic downturn from 1929 to 1939. The period was characterized by high rates of unemployment and poverty; drastic reductions in liquidity, industrial production, and trade; and widespread bank and business failures around the world. The economic contagion began in 1929 in the United States, the largest economy in the world, with the devastating Wall Street stock market crash of October 1929 often considered the beginning of the Depression. Among the countries with the most unemployed were the U.S., the United Kingdom, and Germany.
<br><br>
The Depression was preceded by a period of industrial growth and social development known as the "Roaring Twenties". Much of the profit generated by the boom was invested in speculation, such as on the stock market, which resulted in growing wealth inequality. Banks were subject to minimal regulation under laissez-faire economic policies, resulting in loose lending and widespread debt. By 1929, declining spending had led to reductions in manufacturing output and rising unemployment. Share values continued to rise until the Wall Street crash, after which the slide continued for three years, accompanied by a loss of confidence in the financial system. By 1933, the unemployment rate in the U.S. had risen to 25 percent, about one-third of farmers had lost their land, and about half of its 25,000 banks had gone out of business. The U.S. federal government under President Herbert Hoover was unwilling to intervene heavily in the economy. In the 1932 presidential election, Hoover was defeated by Franklin D. Roosevelt, who from 1933 pursued a set of expansive New Deal programs in order to provide relief and create jobs. In Germany, which depended heavily on U.S. loans, the crisis caused unemployment to rise to nearly 30% and fueled political extremism, paving the way for Adolf Hitler's Nazi Party to rise to power in 1933.
<br><br>
Between 1929 and 1932, worldwide gross domestic product (GDP) fell by an estimated 15%; in the U.S., the Depression resulted in a 30% contraction in GDP.[1] Recovery varied greatly around the world. Some economies, such as the U.S., Germany and Japan started to recover by the mid-1930s; others, like France, did not return to pre-shock growth rates until later in the decade.[2] The Depression had devastating economic effects on both wealthy and poor countries: all experienced drops in personal income, prices (deflation), tax revenues, and profits. International trade fell by more than 50%, and unemployment in some countries rose as high as 33%.[3] Cities around the world, especially those dependent on heavy industry, were heavily affected. Construction virtually halted in many countries, and farming communities and rural areas suffered as crop prices fell by up to 60%.[4][5][6] Faced with plummeting demand and few job alternatives, areas dependent on primary sector industries suffered the most.[7] The outbreak of World War II in 1939 ended the Depression, as it stimulated factory production, providing jobs for women as militaries absorbed large numbers of young, unemployed men.

In a community like Cranfills Gap, very little went unnoticed. There were no Gestapo or NKVD spies earning their State Security keep, but there were neighbors who wanted to know which kin visited whom and where their neighbors had been the last two days.<br><br>
Such information did not so much stabilize the state as sell the local weeklies, The <u>Clifton Record</u> or the <u>Meridian Tribune</u>. To me, <u>The Clifton Record</u> offered richer ore. There seemed to have been more Norwegian ties between Cranfills gap (the Gap) and Clifton than between the Gap and Meridian.<hr class="yr">
<br>
Other expressions of this web of social interest were less beneficial. Religious tension extended into Clyde's home and hobbled household harmony. Louise was a committed Methodist and Clyde was a formally Confirmed Lutheran. Clyde and Louise wed not in Cranfills Gap's St Olaf Lutheran Church, but in a Lutheran Church in Waco. Surely they agreed on mutual acceptance, but the difference continually hampered harmony. Conflicting issues were often decided on the battleground of scriptural quotations. <br><br>
Each, Clyde and Louise, retained their religious affiliation to the end of their lives. They were finally united in their joint graves.

Silk worms were one of Mom's successes. Their life–cycle married the magic of nature with the community of man.
<br><br>
Later, post-war years later, after grandmother died, when Aunt Margaret was left to her own devices in the G. O. - Laura Bronstad home, when Clyde's family moved to and lived in that home, there was, somehow, a mulberry tree just a few yards from the front–porch door.
<br><br>
Other people had them. Si Johnson, father of Mark, had a magnificent, fruitful mulberry in the backyard. It seems they had chickens, a small barn and a cow or cows that grazed the pasture through which a little branch or creek wended.
<br><br>
Up the hill a way from the Johnson's, Past Chris Rohne's house, the Bronstad mulberry was too young to yield much fruit, but the leaves could be fed to the silkworms at school and those domesticated silkworms lived their lives as well for us as for any Asian weaver of silk.
<br><br>
They left behind cocoons of white and yellow and, after metamorphosis and mating, tiny bead rows of eggs that yearned for next year's mulberry leaves.
<br><br>
The mulberry could also be pruned for switches that, once your pants were down, could rip painful red whelps on your leg if ten–year–old–you tried to stretch Mother further than she could go.

Deracination looks hard on these folks; gasoline rationing should have meant little travel, yet they did travel, keeping family sinews taunt. Workers in the military industry were entitled to 8 gallons of gasoline per week. The round–trip from Bellmead to Cranfills Gap must have cost at least 8 gallons. Clyde still had to get back and forth to Blackland Army Airfield, Louise to Bellmead's LaVega school.
<br><br>
I have a recollection so close to the substance of fiction that I do not recommend the recall as factual; it is surely total fancy. But one wonders, "How do people behave under conditions of 'excessive economic control'?"
<br><br>
Cpt. Shipp must have received his Captaincy (military commission to pay grade O-3), because he was an experienced doctor of medicine. {I'm partial to him because he delivered me.} With that combined status, he was over-qualified for all the gasoline and tires he needed. An X–card.
<br><br>
Do I recall a mission by Clyde, despite Mother's near withering caution, a mission for Clyde to siphon 10 gallons from Dr. Shipp's car's tank to the '36 Ford's tank?
<br><br>
Bronstads, Shipps and Tindalls played cards together in Cranfills Gap. If Clyde took all the risks – by siphoning the gas from Dr. Shipp's car and compensated his friend for the gas he must buy, how could the good doctor deny that?
<br><br>
Could Clyde do that just to visit his mother? I could not respect him if he could not. But then, this is just frail memory and speculation. His resources may have been adequate without ration–scoffing.

<p>Presently the auto trip from Cranfills Gap to Killeen (Fort Hood) is 50 miles. In 1940, it was longer. For a brief while, Clyde worked at the PX at Fort Hood (Renamed Fort Cavazos); after WW II broke out, better applications for his skills emerged. 
<blockquote class="Cb2"><img class="ndx" src="../pic/Pinky/Walt-pinky.png" alt="picture Walt Bronstad">&nbsp;&nbsp;{From Wikipedia}<hr class="yr">
<b>Fort Hood</b>
<br><br>
During World War II, tank destroyers were developed to counter German mobile armored units. These were mobile anti-tank guns on armored halftracks or specially developed tanks. Wide-open space was needed for the tank destroyer testing and training, which Texas had in abundance. Andrew Davis (A.D.) Bruce was assigned to organize a new Tank Destroyer Tactical and Firing Center, and he chose Killeen, Texas for the new camp.[2] The War Department announced the selection on 15 January 1942. An initial acquisition of 180,000 acres (730 km2) was made, and it was estimated that the camp would cost $22.8 million for the land, facilities, and development of utilities. The date of completion was set for 15 August 1942.
<br><br>
About 300 families had to move from their homes to make room for the camp area and the communities of Clear Creek, Elijah, and Antelope were demolished to facilitate construction of the base. The old Sugar Loaf community, historically called the "Cradle of Killeen," provided the city with many of its first citizens in 1882. All that remains of the community is the mountain from which it took its name, located in the Fort Cavazos area. To lessen the burden of moving, the Army agreed to allow land to be used for grazing for a nominal grazing fee. This grazing arrangement still continues today.
<br><br>
In mid-August, the camp was occupied and the official opening took place on 18 September 1942. Camp Hood was named in February for the Confederate General John Bell Hood, who commanded Hood's Texas Brigade during the American Civil War, part of a series of new training camps named for notable regional military leaders together with Camps Carson, Campbell and Atterbury

Mylinda was adopted. My Aunt Ina Jo, once told me after Mylinda's suicide that Ina's Father, Will Walton, upon hearing of Ina and Ernest's efforts to adopt a baby girl in Dallas, replied, "You're going a long way to find trouble."

<br><br>
After marriage and children, Mylinda battled depression, or so the diagnosis and brain–fry remediation of the time, late '60's to mid '90's. Economic bust in the Permian Basin simply savaged the family. So when Ina told me of her Father's 50 year old assessment she must have been reassessing herself. — Mind you at this point, in the wake of all her parents, brothers and sisters (save one) deaths, she had also lost her remarkable husband, Ernest, to cancer (chalk anoter win for tobacco.) her remarkably loved son, Dick, to medically mistreated asthma, her beloved daughter, Mylinda, to interpersonal conflict, dubious medical treatment, and and security in economic miasma choking families of boom–time mentalities.

<blockquote class="Cm2"><img class="ndx" src="../pic/Pinky/Walt-pinky.png" alt="picture Walt Bronstad">&nbsp;&nbsp;Clyde and family lived in the Blum house 1945–1947; it was wonderfully spacious, having more rooms than we could purpose. One or more upstairs rooms was locked, securing others' property, there was a sewing room in which very little was sewn.
<br><br>
In that house, I was first aware of being ill, spending nights on an Army surplus folding cot in the kitchen. Perhaps for warmth, perhaps for medicated steam. In that house, Bob suffered mumps in his adolescence: Dick and I were sternly warned to keep our distance, both to avoid disease and to avoid the wrath of an inexplicably testy Bob. In that house, new–born Bette came home as an infant, separating me from a Mother's attention.
<br><br>
In that house, for the better part of the summer, I owned Mother, all to my own, for Clyde and Bob were away in Kansas and states further North, earning money on wheat harvesting crew.
<br><br>
In that house, Mother taught me love of the pussy–willow catkins bulging day by day in spring warmth, until the slough of spring hail surrounded the house and shocked the pussy–willow into pause.
<br><br>
In that house, I now think, I witnessed a Mother making her nest for her new chick.

In my childhood memory of that winter–return from the visit to Wichita Falls, Texas, freezing rain chased us home much of the way from North to Central Texas. As to the loan, whether fictitious, fruitful or frustrated, the Clyde Bronstad–Barton Peterson partnership worked for a few years. Worked until the economic absurdity of four grocers vieing for a living in rural, declining Cranfills Gap dictated that any with better outside purchase ought to leave. And unhappily leave, Clyde, years later, would.

<h4>1950-06-18   Letter from Bob</h4>
<blockquote class="wiki">
<p class="right">June 18, 1950</p>
<p>Dear Mother,</p>
<p>I just wrote Wade, Just got your letter.Why the special delivery? I was very glad to receive it. My hardiest thanks for the new preacher. Ina Jo hurt her arm, or rather elbow, yesterday -- had it X-rayed but nothing was broken. She fell on it in the bath-house of the swimming pool while preparing for a swim.</p>
<p>I'm worried about Bernadine. did she throw a rod or run out of gas? When is camp for the young people starting? Please let me know.</p>
<p>I have been painting for the last two weeks with a few other odd jobs thrown in. the painting is very distasteful. I have read a very good book on beliefs, and I hve no one with which to discuss it. In fact everyone around here lives in a different world than mine. Ina Jo's relations are limited to what I can do for her. Ernest is always busy --they don't offer me any transportation.</p>
<p>Does Clyde's shirt fit O.K.?</p>
<p>I have been thinking about coming home and helping Papa. Do you think I could help him any? I would be perfectly willing even though maybe I could 'nt get a car. People always think of what they could have done to help after the old ones are already gone.
Please advise.</p>
<p>I would like it fine if you were to move to the old house. When I get home I would Like to bring Joanne Home with me so you can get to know her. Mother, I love her and I want you to love her too. She is so sweet. We have been writing each other pretty often.</p>
<p>All my love,</p>
<p>Bobby

<blockquote class="Cr2"><img class="ndx" src="../pic/Pinky/Walt-pinky.png" alt="picture Walt Bronstad">&nbsp;&nbsp;
Bob is temporarily staying and working for his Uncle and Aunt, Ernest and Ina Jo Mapp. Bob, age 18 at the time, had already graduated High School and finished his Freshman year at <u>Clifton Junior College</u>. Likely he was in Odessa to earn money for his Sophmre year and other concerns of a young man. Ernest Mapp owned Mapp Tank Company, a service company in the Oil Industry - the main reason for Odessa's prosperity. Tanks were massive steel enclosures holding many thousand gallons of crude oil; they needed painting for corrosion resistance. Painting oilfield storage tanks was hazardous considering their height and summer heat. Likely Bob painted houses and company structures plus other duties as assigned.
<br><br>
The new preacher may have been Reverend Terpstra. Not a schollarly star in the firmament, but small, rural churches like the Methodist Church in Cranfills Gap were hard pressed to fill a vacancy. And a man of commitment and perseverence can overcome literary lackings.
<br><br>
Ina Jo was Louise's youngest sister. The pool was within an enclosure; else at the Mapp home's location near the Tank Yard, a swimming Ina Jo would have been expposed to the view of the 'roughnecks' manning the company yard. Never did the pool's use come to my awareness.
<br><br>
Bernadine was Bob's car, not a girlfriend. He had invested a lot of himself into <a href="Holbrook_Winnon_G(Bob).html#Bernadine" target="_blank">Bernadine</a>. Camp for young people was probably <u>Methodist Youth Camp</u> at Glen Rose which Bob seemed to have enjoyed.
<br><br>
Bob, ever thoughtful, must have used some of his hard won income to buy Clyde a birthday present.
<br><br>
His thoughtfulness extends to wanting to help, Papa, his grandfather W. T. (Will) Walton. Will was 72 at the time; after 50 years of farming the wear was showing; indeed, Will would last less than 7 years more. Bob could also be a little home sick and want a good reason to come home earlier.
<br><br>
A move to the old house meant moving from "Homer's house" close by the highway to the Bronstad house, just 200 yards up the escarpment. Grandmother Laura Bronstad, died in April, Caregiver-daughter Marguerite had no income and little prospects of much. The Bronstad house was larger than Homer's, but more pioneer in equipment. Louise would not willingly return to a wood cook stove and hot water dipped from the wooden cook stoves water compartment. Clyde arranged for Pinky Brynn to wire the house for 220v, Clyde and Louise bought an electric range, an electric water heater, and an enamel cabinet complete with sink, drainage and hot and cold water connections. Then Mother, (who probably earned more than Father) would move in.
<br><br>
We all loved Joanne Jones; to Bob's crushing sorrow, Joanne later dumped him. Mama Jones wanted a son-in-law with grander aspirations than school teacher.

With the icy wind at our backs, we stepped on the tiny, brittle, lacy, Ice covered roadside pools to hear the tinkling sound. Later we attended East Ward and high school in town, riding in a buggy or surrey with hot bricks at our feet in winter.<br><br>
Much deference was given academic achievement and hard work; rarely did the latter preclude school attendance. The thrust of our purpose was adherence to spiritual values. Music was important.<br><br>
Some happiest times were singing around the piano. My father said every man should sing at his work, and truly my parents said their frustrations, exultations, joys, and faith in songs.<br><br><hr>
My first husband lost his life accidentally shortly after our son, Bobby, was born. We moved to Cranfills Gap in 1934. The road there from Hamilton, which we often made, was dusty and crooked. Once, Bobby, then four, getting out of the car to investigate a signal of trouble, and anticipating mechanical opportunities, clapped his hands and jubilantly cried,<br><br>"O Boy, look, Mommy, a flat!"
<br><br>
Clyde and I were married while he was in the grocery business and I was teaching.
Our two children were born at Cranfills Gap.<br><br>
Bobby was attending Texas Wesleyan College when we moved lo Fort Worth. After finishing, he worked as a tool designer, going later to Wisconsin. There he married Charlotte Munger; they have three children, Terri, Rex, and Mark. He is working for American Can.
<br><br>
Walton attended the Universities of Texas and Michigan. He lives in Austin with his wife, nee Pat Bird, his son, Matthew, and twin daughters, Kate and Kris.
<br><br>
Bette spends her extra time and cash traveling; she is getting another degree in Engineering.
<br><br>
Clyde, now eighty, still embellishes his fascinating stories of early life of Hamilton and Bosque counties
<br><br>
We still walk over grasslands where my grandfather J. M. Embrey, nearly a century ago had hundreds of sheep west of Hamilton.
<br><br>
The creek still runs part time that cooled my mother's feet and furnished mud to relieve her bee stings as she helped her father. Depressions remain where massive rocks were removed to build structures in town. Recently we found a fossil gastropod under a massive oak where my mother had played.
<br><br>
We still see the wild flowers coloring the pastures. The blue bells, winecups, Indian blankets, and paint brushes are still there.
We see the cedars clutching the hillsides, the oak clusters cleared goat-high, the willows with thirsty roots crowding the streams as we travel near Hamilton.
These pictures and memories I treasure. -- Louise Bronstad
