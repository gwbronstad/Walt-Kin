<p>The tempo of life in Cranfills Gap 35 years later seemd not much different; slower perhaps in the 1950's, given that there were relatively fewer young people in the 1950's to leven he community with the yeast of youth.</p><br>
<p> The newspaperman, Jas H Knight, frequently took a jocund turn with his subject matter; this made the commonplace more readworthy. Sometimes however it is hard to know when reportage is serious and not jest.</p> <br>
<p> Casi in point is the 1917-07-27 entry where Clyde is the assistant freight conductor.
