   <h3>Clyde's Early Years.</h3>
   <h3> The <u>Clifton Record</u> (a Bosque County, Texas weekly newspaper) recorded the comings and goings in quiet neighboring areas like Cranfills Gap; all the better to increase readership beyond Clifton, TX. I mined microfilm of the <u>Clifton Record</u> for family references. I saw slimmest images of Clyde's past, much as one might see, passing a wooden fence, a kinetoscopic view of a neighbors back yard.</h3>

However because of the rigid enforcement of the custom officers they were not able to fulfill the wishes of their friends in bringing back Mexican souvenirs. But to the most insistent, they brought home a wet sponge.</p>

<h3><img class="mlr114px"  src="../pic/Pinky/Gulbrand-pinky.png" alt="Gulbrand pic">G. O. Bronstad Bosque Pioneer, Passes Away.</h3>
<p>G. O. Bronstad, pioneer Bosque County citizen, died at his home at Cranfills Gap, Sunday, July 19, 1937, at about 1:45 p. m. Funeral services were conducted Monday afternoon at the St. Olaf Lutheran Church with interment in the St. Olaf Cemetery.</p>
<p>Mr. Bronstad was born March 9, 1856, in Romedal, Hedemarken, Norway. In 1874, at the age of 18, he emigrated to the United States, coming direct to Bosque County, Texas, where he joined his brother, C. O., at Valley Mills. Here in Bosque County he at once made his home and in due time adopted this country as his own. During his long life he has been an active and contributing citizen.</p>
<p>From 1874 to 1886 he lived successively at Valley Mills, Norway Mills and Morgan, engaging in business and learning merchandising. In 1886 he moved to Cranfills Gap, and opened his business concern in Cranfills Gap. Thus Mr. Bronstad successfully rounded out more than fifty years in business in this one location.</p>
<p>
In the land of his nativity he was baptized, and after proper training, was confirmed in the Lutheran Church. To this faith, confessed early in life, he remained true to the end.</p>
<p>This now departed highly respected citizen, lived a quiet, unassuming life, sincere in spirit, sympathetic, generous, and cheerful. In spite of severe experiences in business, he remained of sympathetic and kindly nature, giving service to his friends from far and near. All men were greeted with a smile in the Bronstad Store.</p>

<p>Due to the absence of his pastor, Rev. W. J. Maakestad, Rev. P. E. Thorson of Norse conducted the funeral services, assisted by Rev. O. T. Boe of Clifton and Rev. Farmer, Cranfills Gap. Inspiring music was furnished by St. Olaf Male Quartet, and by Mrs. Troll and Miss Knudson in a vocal duet.</p>
<p>Beside his wife, he leaves six children, Otis, <mark>Clyde</mark>, and Homer, Margaret, Mrs. C. L. Rohne and Mrs. Douglas Hudson. These all reside at Cranfills Gap except Mrs. Hudson, who lives in Holdenville, Okla. He is also survived by one brother, Otto, of Waco, and three sisters, Carrie and Syverine Bronstad of Waco, and Mrs Pernella Anderson, Clifton.</p>
<p>The large gathering of sorrowing friends and relatives that overflowed the spacious church was something of an indication of the high esteem in which Mr. Bronstad was held. Representatives from every section of Bosque County, from Hamilton and Coryell Counties, came to pay tribute to a good friend, a christian gentleman, an high-class merchant, a man.

<p>Presently the auto trip from Cranfills Gap to Killeen (Fort Hood) is 50 miles. In 1940, it was longer. For a brief while, Clyde worked at the PX at Fort Hood (Renamed Fort Cavazos); after WW II broke out, better applications for his skills emerged.

<b>Fort Hood</b>
<br><br>
During World War II, tank destroyers were developed to counter German mobile armored units. These were mobile anti-tank guns on armored halftracks or specially developed tanks. Wide-open space was needed for the tank destroyer testing and training, which Texas had in abundance. Andrew Davis (A.D.) Bruce was assigned to organize a new Tank Destroyer Tactical and Firing Center, and he chose Killeen, Texas for the new camp.[2] The War Department announced the selection on 15 January 1942. An initial acquisition of 180,000 acres (730 km2) was made, and it was estimated that the camp would cost $22.8 million for the land, facilities, and development of utilities. The date of completion was set for 15 August 1942.
<br><br>
About 300 families had to move from their homes to make room for the camp area and the communities of Clear Creek, Elijah, and Antelope were demolished to facilitate construction of the base. The old Sugar Loaf community, historically called the "Cradle of Killeen," provided the city with many of its first citizens in 1882. All that remains of the community is the mountain from which it took its name, located in the Fort Cavazos area. To lessen the burden of moving, the Army agreed to allow land to be used for grazing for a nominal grazing fee. This grazing arrangement still continues today.
<br><br>
In mid-August, the camp was occupied and the official opening took place on 18 September 1942. Camp Hood was named in February for the Confederate General John Bell Hood, who commanded Hood's Texas Brigade during the American Civil War, part of a series of new training camps named for notable regional military leaders together with Camps Carson, Campbell and Atterbury

</p>In Mother's absence, I was cared for by a local Gap woman, whom Mother dearly loved, at times and by Mother's niece, Vivian Embry, at other times.

{From Wikipedia}<hr> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Cavazos" target="_blank">Fort Hood, now Fort Cavazos</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i>, named in honor of Gen. Richard E. Cavazos, a native Texan and the US Army’s first Hispanic four-star general, was a military training facility during World War II, Its origin was the need for wide-open space to test and train with World War II tank destroyers. The War Department announced the location in January 1942, and the initial completion was set for that August.
<br><br>
During World War II, tank destroyers were developed to counter German mobile armored units. These were mobile anti-tank guns on armored halftracks or specially developed tanks. Wide-open space was needed for the tank destroyer testing and training, which Texas had in abundance. Andrew Davis (A.D.) Bruce was assigned to organize a new Tank Destroyer Tactical and Firing Center, and he chose Killeen, Texas for the new camp.[2] The War Department announced the selection on 15 January 1942. An initial acquisition of 180,000 acres (730 km2) was made, and it was estimated that the camp would cost $22.8 million for the land, facilities, and development of utilities. The date of completion was set for 15 August 1942.
<br><br>
About 300 families had to move from their homes to make room for the camp area and the communities of Clear Creek, Elijah, and Antelope were demolished to facilitate construction of the base. The old Sugar Loaf community, historically called the "Cradle of Killeen," provided the city with many of its first citizens in 1882. All that remains of the community is the mountain from which it took its name, located in the Fort Cavazos area. To lessen the burden of moving, the Army agreed to allow land to be used for grazing for a nominal grazing fee. This grazing arrangement still continues today.[citation needed]
<br><br>
In mid-August, the camp was occupied and the official opening took place on 18 September 1942. Camp Hood was named in February for the Confederate General John Bell Hood, who commanded Hood's Texas Brigade during the American Civil War,[3] part of a series of new training camps named for notable regional military leaders together with Camps Carson, Campbell and Atterbury.[4]
<br><br>
The original facilities provided housing and training sites for nearly 38,000 troops. In January 1943, an additional 16,000 acres (65 km2) in Bell County and 34,943 acres (141.41 km2) in Coryell County near Gatesville, Texas were purchased. The site near Gatesville was known as the sub-camp and later as North Camp Hood. During the war years, North Camp Hood housed nearly 40,000 troops and 4,000 prisoners of war, and was the site for the southern branch of the United States Disciplinary Barracks.[citation needed]
<br><br>
At the end of 1942, there were about 45,000 troops living and training at Camp Hood and in late June 1943 it peaked at almost 95,000 troops,[3] which was maintained until early 1944.

<h4>H. F. Hansen Dies Suddenly Friday <img class="mlr114px" src="../pic/Pinky/FerdiHansen-pinky.png" alt="picture Hans Ferdinand Hansen"></h4>
<p><a href="https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/G9MB-3T4" target="_blank">Hans Ferdinand Hansen</a><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i> was born Dec. 24, 1886. His parents were <img class="mlr114px" src="../pic/Pinky/HansHansen-pinky.png" alt="picture Hans Hansen"><u>Hans Jorgen Hansen</u> and <img class="mlr114px" src="../pic/Pinky/Petra(Foss)-pinky.png" alt="picture Petra(Foss) Hansen"><u>Petra Foss Hansen.</u> He was baptized in infancy at the St. Olaf Rock Church, and later renewed his baptismal covenant on the day of his confirmation, June 15, 1902, being confirmed by the Rev. J. K. Rystad.</p>
<p>He attended public and parochial schools under Prof. A. H. Denby Olsen and attended Clifton College in 1904.</p>
<p>He was united in marriage to <img class="mlr114px" src="../pic/Pinky/MaryTergerson-pinky.png" alt="picture Gena Marie Tergersen"><u>Gena Marie Tergerson</u> on Aug. 2, 1906 by the Rev. G. G. Odengaard. To this union were born five daughters, two of whom died in infancy. He is survived by his wife and three daughters, Jewel Pauline (Mrs. Alton Tindall of Phillips, Texas; Wilma Adeline (Mrs. Oscar Knudson) of Carlsbad, New Mexico, and Frances Lee (Mrs. Samuel Coffey) of Winslow, Arizona, and three grandchildren, A. W. Tindall, Jr., Mary Joyce Tindall and Roger Lane Coffey. He also leaves to mourn his passing, six sisters, Mrs. Mary Gaustad, Mrs. J. T. Jenson, <img class="mlr114px" src="../pic/Pinky/Laura-pinky.png" alt="picture Laura (Hansen) Bronstad"><u>Mrs. G. O. Bronstad</u> and Mrs. Newman Hastings, all of Cranfills Gap; Mrs E. E.

<p>Mr. Hansen and his bride settled on the Jorgen Hansen homestead, one of the most beautiful and imposing country homes in this section, pre-empted by his parents many years before, his Father and mother having come from Denmark and Norway respectively. In the atmosphere of parental love and devotion he and his loving wife reared their children, in mutual love and happiness, until the day of his sad and sudden departure.</p>
<p>He came to assume responsibility early in life, his father passing away when, Ferdie, as he was always called, was only twelve years old. Being the only son and the youngest in the family, his responsibilities were even greater. But he grew into manhood under steady Christian influence and became a pillar in the church and community, and serving as a trustee of the local Lutheran Church at the time of his death. All who knew Mr. Hansen loved him because of his kind and pleasing disposition. Likewise he loved his friends and neighbors and enjoyed every association, making the most of the more beautiful things of life. He loved and was loved. Deep in his heart there was more tenderness, more understanding, more genuine love and affection for his family and fellowmen than you find in any man, save and except the most deeply consecrated souls.</p>
<p>He departed this life at 1:45 o'clock Friday morning, June 12, 1942, at the age of 55 years, 5 months and 18 days. Without and seeming premonition, he had lived that he might depart to his Savior, suddenly. He prayed fervently that he may be allowed to live, but said, "All would be well." The Lord saw fit to call him home to his heavenly mansions, that he might live in glorious eternity and share early his eternal reward.</p>
<p>Funeral services were conducted from the home at 3:00 o'clock and from the Lutheran Church in Cranfills gap at 3:30 o'clock Sunday afternoon. Interment was made in the St Olaf Cemetery, with Rev. B. R. Maakestad officiating at all services.</p>

Deracination looks hard on these folks; gasoline rationing should have meant little travel, yet they did travel, keeping family sinews taunt. Workers in the military industry were entitled to 8 gallons of gasoline per week. The round–trip from Bellmead to Cranfills Gap must have cost at least 8 gallons. Clyde still had to get back and forth to Blackland Army Airfield, Louise to Bellmead's LaVega school.
<br><br>
I have a recollection so close to the substance of fiction that I do not recommend the recall as factual; it is surely total fancy. But one wonders, "How do people behave under conditions of 'rigid economic control'?"
<br><br>
Cpt. Shipp must have received his Captaincy (military commission to pay grade O-3), because he was an experienced doctor of medicine. {I'm partial to him because he delivered me.} With that combined status, he was over-qualified for all the gasoline and tires he needed. An X–card.
<br><br>
Do I recall a mission by Clyde, despite Mother's near withering caution, a mission for Clyde to siphon 10 gallons from Dr. Shipp's car's tank to the '36 Ford's tank?
<br><br>
Bronstads, Shipps and Tindalls played cards together in Cranfills Gap. If Clyde took all the risks – by siphoning the gas from Dr. Shipp's car and compensated his friend for the gas he must buy, how could the good doctor deny that?
<br><br>
Could Clyde do that just to visit his mother? I could not respect him if he could not. But then, this is just frail memory and speculation. His resources may have been adequate without ration–scoffing.

<p>I slept between Clyde and Louise in the back bedroom double bed, my middle name could have been 'contraceptive'. Bob had the front bedroom all to himself. Frequently there was a fifth person there, but I don't remember who or where she slept. Some times "she" was Vivian Embrey, one of Mother's first cousins. During wartime there were better and higher uses for able workers, and Vivian probably responded accordingly.</p> 

<h4>Crayons</h4>
<p>Clyde heated the living room with a massive, fuel oil furnace. The outside was enamel brown. I loved Crayolas. I loved the intense colors of Crayons but found them faithless. Yes, one could draw a line on paper with the red crayon, but it had betrayed the  brilliance of the Crayola, the drawn line lost saturation. It betrayed it's promise.
</p>
<p>But if one applied the Crayola to the heated, brown enamel surface, one could draw a drippy line that retained the saturation of the wax crayon. This was wonderful; Crayolas became faithful; they fulfilled, the red, yellow, green, violet and blue promises, even white kept it's promise on brown enamel.
</p>
<p>The smell of liquid Crayola soon got my parents attention; they rushed out of the kitchen into the living room, alerted by an unfamiliar odor. They cavalierly stopped my artistic endeavors with some incomprehensible warning about fire. I saw no fire, but stop I must.</p>
<p>Later, I discovered my artistry could be out of view if I crawled behind the furnace on my belly, I might reached for Michelangelo‘s artistic height, though prone on the floor. The odor continued to give me away. Soon spring ended the need for heat and withdrew my magic canvas.</p>

<p>That was a problem for Clyde, he could not take me to Blackland, could not leave me at home because I threatened to follow him on foot. He drove along struggling with the dilemma I posed. He grasped upon, "I'll have to give you to a Nigger Lady." The threat didn't really process until Clyde pulled alongside an Afro-American woman walking along the roadside; Clyde rolled down my car window and said, "Hey lady, would you like a little boy?". I looked into her strange, astonished face and screamed, "I'll stay home! I'll stay home!" 
</p>
<p>Clyde ended such further strife by locking the car doors at home. But that didn't fix my need for security, for having an adult around. There was a war going on, who'll save me from the Nazis? One day, as Clyde slid in behind the wheel, door half closed, I ran up, jumped on the running board and grasped the external hinge of the '36 Ford driver's door. When the door fully shut, the closing hinge burst my right middle finger like a balloon. I remember no more, but I'm sure the event was traumatic for both Clyde and me. 80 years later the finger is still looks slightly mangled.
</p>
<p>What to do with toddler Wally during wartime? Too young to become a latch-key kid, Mom took me to day care with periods of outdoor play (A play mate introduced me to pill bugs.), naps on cots (I was scandalized that boys and girls went together in the same toilet room.), and finger paint or other arts. </p>
<p>On one rare visit to Mother's school, I was drawn to the many profiles of American, Nazi and Japanese war planes, arrayed on the walls above eye level. I learned 'theirs' from 'ours', bombers from fighters.</p>
<p>Like our war birds flying oft above, school posters, radio news and bulletins, and movie newsreels kept the Axis menace ever close to our thoughts.

<h4>Great genitalia show off.</h4>
<p>I knew no preschoolers south of our house, but quite a few of us were to be found to the north. Next door was Gordon Johnson with whom I might play. Gordon connected with more children north to the street corner. One bright day, a juvenile organizing genius had set up among 8 or so preschoolers a deal whereby one child stood security guard against adults at the garage door while boys and girls within might drop their pants to reveal their genitalia to each other.</p>
<p>Well I wasn't going to miss out on that. I had already intuited that sex was powerful, hidden and forbidden, no way I would walk from this apocalypse. </p>
<p>The planning was good but the staging dreadful. With garage doors shut there was almost no light for seeing. Actors were skittish lest a parent appear and punish taboo breakers. The Bellmead 'Naughty Bits Review' broke up almost before it began. Likely there were more performances, but none included me.</p>

<h4>Visitors.</h4>
<p>The <b><u>Clifton Record</u></b> records many visitors to our house; I recall but two. Mother's sister Aubrey's visit was memorable because of the rainy night drive to the train station to pick Aubrey up (or send her off, not sure)</p>
<p>Mother's sister Annie Joy made her visit memorable because she tried to stick me with a nickname. As a bow-legged preschooler with a ten inch stride, my corduroy cuffs whipped past each other with a 'thwip-thwip' sound. Probably amused at my sound, she called me "twisty britches".</p>
<p> What has stayed with me is the preparation. Visitors meant large meals and large meals centered around one or more chickens. Clyde would dispatch a live bird by lodging it's neck between crossed clothes line wires. Then flip the bird to shorten it's suffering. Plunging the bird in a pail of boiling hot water helped Louise pluck the chicken clean of feathers. Then she or Clyde would butcher the bird(s) into what became dinner-table chicken anatomy. Drum stick, thigh, back, wing, breast, liver, gizzard, neck, wish bone.
<br>
<h4>Medicine.</h4>
<p>Childhood anemia meant I could either get iron shots in my butt or eat animal liver. Promising I'd eat liver put off the jabs and eventually I learned to like liver.</p>

<p>On my parents turn to promise, they promise me all the ice cream I wanted if I'd submit to Dr Aid's removing my tonsils. Dr Aid laid me down on an ironing table and began to suffocate me with a handkerchief while my parents held me down. He poured perfume on the handkerchief and I recall no more till I awoke. Groggy, throat on fire, I wanted no ice cream. Nothing. Trust corroded.</p>

Uncle Homer, like Father Clyde had worked in the store, but Uncle Homer followed a path of teaching, pausing after a position at Blanket Texas. Following that he seems to have run the Bronstad Store from 1942 until he was drafted.

<h4>Child remembers</h4>
<p>Clyde and family lived in the Blum house 1945–1947; it was wonderfully spacious, having more rooms than we could purpose. One or more upstairs rooms was locked, securing others' property, (Mrs. M. J. Mikelson? Mr. E. A. Thompson?) there was a sewing room in which very little was sewn, my bedroom and Bob's bedroom. Downstairs was a smallish kitchen, an enclosed back porch, a bathroom complete with a heat-on-flow hot water heater that intimidated Clyde, a large dining room, an entry room and a family room.</p>
<p>
Though I haven't been on that property in over 3/4 of a century, it still houses many of my childhood memories. In that house, &mdash;</p><BR>
<ul style="list-style-type: none; margin: 2px; padding: 2px;">
<li> Though I had been ill before, in the Blum house I was first aware of being ill, spending nights on an Army surplus folding cot in the kitchen. Perhaps for warmth, perhaps for medicated steam.</li>
<li> Bob suffered mumps in his adolescence; he was quarantined to the back, enclosed porch; Dick and I were sternly warned to keep our distance, both to avoid disease and to avoid the wrath of an inexplicably testy Bob.</li>
<li> Mother taught me love of the pussy–willow catkins bulging day by day in spring warmth, until the slough of spring hail surrounded the house and shocked the pussy–willow into pause.</li>
<li> I witnessed Mother making her nest for her new chick.</li>
<li> New–born Bette came home as an infant, separating me from a Mother's attention.</li>
<li> We would gather around the dining table to play dominoes, or play with my new Christmas present, a <a href="https://www.bigbangcannons.com/Products/Cannons/Home-Page-Specials/ConestogaCivilWarCannon" target="_blank">Big-Bang Canon</a><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i>.</li>
<li> Mother began teaching me to read.</li>
<li> In fall of 1946 I began elementary school .</li>
<li> Disney comic books became my reading choice.</li>
<li> Aunt Travis sold us <u>The World Book Encyclopedia.</u></li>
<li><u>World Book</u> illustrations of WWI and WWI military kit refueled a little boy's fascination with war.</li>
<li> I got a pet white rabbit, which I was hopeless at taking care of.</li>
<li> Later, I got a dog, with results no better.</li>
<li> Rather than wear my bright red shirt-jacket past the bull grazing in a field along my path to school, I played hokey. Mom and Dad couldn't understand how dangerous wearing red near a bull was. But then, they probably had not seen the right movie cartoons.</li>
<li> One Christmas I got a <u>Gilbert's Chemistry Set.</u> My Cousin, Janetha June did well at TCU, studying chemistry, but no one in the house could field my questions about chemistry. </li>
<li> For the better part of one summer, (probably the summer of 1947) I owned Mother, all to my own, &mdash; except for little sister who slept a lot. Clyde and Bob were away in Kansas and states further North, earning money on wheat harvesting crew. (This was the summer Clyde and Homer sold out to Clarence Johnson and Homer resumed his career in Public Education.) They returned by train, we met them, late at night at the train station in Meridian. Bob brought me back tiny black and white plastic Scott terriers mounted on magnets.</li>
<li> I got my clock cleaned and a first lesson in astronomy when I insisted on playing football with much larger Bob and Arlen Rohne.</li>
<li> Mother showed me milkweed in the front pasture and it's importance to Monarch Butterflys.</li>
</ul><br>
<hr>
<p>Post WW II, Clyde believed, would see a return of a depression. Maybe this was more an argument for Mother's benefit, clearly family ties to Cranfills Gap would help him resist the Urban pull that urged so many away from Bosque County to urban areas like Fort Worth, Dallas, Houston and San Antonio. His family model was of a Father passing a livelihood on to a son, even though, in his Father's case, that son was the oldest boy, Otis. But Otis had switched from Bronstad store to Gap Postmaster. Now the two younger sons, Clyde and Homer gave the r&ocirc;le of merchant a go. That model of legacy likely led Clyde to showing me some of the work of business.</p>
<p>Clyde some times took me with him to country locations connected to store commerce. We visited a farmer who sold him a cow. The farmer led the beast to the prepared place; wanting to dispatch the cow with most certainty, he took very careful, close aim with his .22 rifle, fired and the beast obediently collapsed in place. Clyde and the farmer went about the familiar work of butchering an animal into food.</p>

<p>Another time, Clyde took me into the countryside where a man made rope. We watched as the clever but simple machine braided smaller strands into into lengthening and stronger rope. There was something strangely furtive about the approach to the property and the exchanges between the man and Clyde. Almost fourscore years later, my guess is that hemp growing was again made illegal after the end of WW II, and this farmer was still pursuing a livelihood growing hemp for rope.</P>  

<p>Gul, (Norwegian for yellow) was Grandma Bronstad's yellow tabby. His yellow coloring gave poor protection from Central Texas' intense sun; he developed an ugly cancerous lesion over his yellow-white nose. Family consensus was that Gul's got to go. The onerous task fell to Father. I got wind of the mission; for me, "death" was but a word, I wanted to see it.</p>
<p>Father disliked guns, he never bought one, once he had near fatally shot himself in the thigh. He borrowed a .22 rifle from a friend and took me, Gul, the rifle around the mountain. The road, was a dirt road, Wiese street going past Aunt Margaret's gravel pit (which during highway building gave Aunt Margaret a little income) around to geographic "Cranfill's Gap" a low space (1070 feet) between "mountains", almost the other side of the (diminutive) Cranfills Mountain (1130 feet) from the town site of Cranfills Gap. Here the roadside was littered with used cans, bottles, metal parts: mostly stuff that would not burn; most people chose to burn their waste material and carted off the nonburnable to the de-facto Cranfills Gap dump. This is where Clyde was to dispatch Gul.</p>
<p>Clyde aimed carefully for Gul's brain, fired, and Gul shot, flat-footed, six feet into the air, as if to exclaim, "I had so much more life in me." Our silent reply was:, "yes, but we are merciful and you are become ugly and we are afraid of catching your cancer."</p>
<p> Rather than leave Gul for the vultures in the dump, Clyde brought a tow sack to take Gul back for a burial in Grandma's flower bed.</p> <br>
<p> Clyde taught me to fly a kite one windy spring.</p>

<p>On the long driveway to the Blum house, I learned to ride my over-sized, Christmas bike, gingerly using the barbed-wire fence to get mounted and started. (The bike was about the right size when I rode it to Junior high school.)</p>

<p>Years later, the Viking theater in downtown Cranfills Gap fed my love for cinema. With a dime, I could walk to downtown and get 1&cent; back in change after buying admission.</p>
<p>Early fare was Westerns, and one frequent trope in the Westerns was the bad guys tying up the good guys. Lesson learned; any sensible person would practice untying really tough knots. So I demanded of my Father: "Tie me up, Daddy."</p>
<p>To my dismay, Clyde didn't seem to comprehend the existential significance. One must master getting untied. Eventually he relented and tied me up loosely. Hah, mastered that.  "Tie me up better." &hellip;</p>
<p>And so on for a few iterations, until Clyde tired of the game and ended it by tying me up for real. </p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. W. E. Mapp and children, Dickie and Linda, of Odessa were in Cranfills Gap over the week-end visiting in the home of Mrs. Mapp's sister and brother-in-law, <mark>Mr. and Mrs Clyde Bronstad</mark>. . . .</p>

<blockquote class="Cm2"><img class="mlr40px" src="../pic/Pinky/Walt-pinky.png" alt="picture Walt Bronstad"><strong>'Homer's House' Hwy 22, FM 219 in Cranfills Gap, Texas.</strong><br>(~1947 - 1950)<br>
<h4>Downsizing</h4>
<p>We still called it Homer's house. He had built it for his growing family. I had visited Maurice there to play. It was only a few minutes walk from the Blum house,  Aunt Travis would greet me and Maurice and we might play inside or in a sand pile behind the house. Uncle Homer and family left the house for the final time September 1947, moving to Vernon TX.</p>
<p>The house was four rooms. Mother got a gate legged table whose wings opened to accommodate dinner guests, but collapsed to take up little room. Similarly she got a spinet piano, a piano that trims keys to save space. A silver butane tank outside fed space heaters indoors through rubber hoses secured with friction connectors. Such perishable connections may be the reason the house burned to the ground sometime in the '80s.</p>
<p>One peculiarity of the bath was the right sided tub installed naked side out to accommodate left side plumbing. To see in the lavatory mirror, I had to stand on the edge of the tub whilst leaning on the lavatory. Once I slipped and got a scar on my lower occipital bone.

<p>Highway 22, just yards south, was still under construction. Soil disruption meant many critters had to relocate. One night I slipped into bed (shared with Mom and Dad again) and got the rough jabs of a scorpion just settled in his new home twixt bed-sheets.</p>
<p>Ofttimes I remained awake while Mom and Dad discussed the day. Shard's of Uncle Homer's 1939 loss of school superintendency posed a puzzle. Clyde defended his brother Homer by blaming Homer's brother-in-law and fellow teacher, Orin, for bad counsel. Mother's side of the conversation eluded my understanding or was not remembered or sleep took over. Later I learned that Homer had manipulated the 1939 class ranking scores to shift the free UT tuition award from a woman graduate to a man. (In rural understanding, women's highest careers were child rearing, professions were for men.) A German-American kin of the slighted woman sat on the school board and would not stand the slight to a German-American by Norwegian-Americans. Thus Homer's contract ended when the majority of the school board concurred.</p>
<p>The <u>Clifton Record</u> recorded Homer's climb through the ranks of rural schools from small community schools in the area to the superintendency of the Cranfills Gap Independent School District. His fall from grace looked painful, but educator to the core, he would want his painful path to have instructional value. Surely it did for his pupils, family and community.</p> 
<p>One lesson in <u>The Clifton Record</u>'s community reporting is the warm family and community support given to Homer and family during exile to Blanket, TX. I feel a special kinship to his difficulties finding a place in this world, having stumbled many times in my own life. I like to think we got some of our perseverance from a common source.</p> 
<p>Jon Henderson lived across Hwy 22; he was my best friend by proximity. We were in the same grade, both took piano lessons with the same teacher, quit lessons almost together. There was an undertone of tension between us, his father, Dink Henderson, owned a competing grocery in the Gap, having bought out Ralph Dillon (Spouse of 4 <sup>th</sup> grade teacher, Mrs. DIllon.) One bit of play was climbing the frail tree at the corner of the house and moving over to the roof to climb up from there. The dry cedar shake shingles gave too little purchase for leather soles and I slid helplessly down the roof. Knowing I was doomed, my subconscious flashed my short life before me. But I landed uneventfully, just missing the cactus in the flower bed.</p>
<p>One autumn, we were practicing flight running up Dink Henderson's chicken coop Jon Henderson and I. The 5th landing was a little rough; my left foot told me, "NO!, Thou Shalt not Walk with Me."</p>
<p>I crawled back home, across Hwy 22 to gales of laughter from Jon and Mac, his older brother. They thought my act hilarious.</p>
<p>With some difficulty, I gingerly mounted my bike at home (Homer's House) and limp-pedaled to the store where Clyde realized, indeed, I had a problem. It was off to the Holt Clinic in Meridian the next day where my leg was adorned with a plaster cast and a steel stirrup to bear my walking weight. </p>

<p><mark>Mr. Clyde Bronstad</mark>  and Mr. Barton Pederson formed a partnership grocery business Monday in purchasing the Clarence Johnson grocery.</p>
<blockquote class="Cb2"><img class="mlr40px" src="../pic/Pinky/Walt-pinky.png" alt="picture Walt Bronstad"> 
<img src="../pic/CPB/19361215-OtisBronstad.jpg" alt="Otis at Bronstad Store" width="225" height="200" style="float:right">&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<p>The store was in the same building that Clyde's Father, Gulbrand, had built in 1913. A long, narrow building, facing roughly East North-east, it was made of field limestone walls topped with a flat roof that sloped toward the rear entrance.</p><br> 
<p><u><mark>Uncle Otis</mark> in front of Bronstad Store.</u></p>
<p>The front two-thirds opened with two display window and a front double screen door in between. The show windows might display perishable fruit like bananas or apples, community notices or special prices written bold on butcher paper. I admired Clyde's calligraphy. Sometimes trade inducement schemes were displayed. A given amount of purchases might entitle one to a china plate or a gravy boat.</p> 
<p>Floors were pine, darkened from decades of sweeping the floors with sawdust sprinkled with kerosene after closing. There were 2 soda pop coolers, chilled with ice in water so cold it hurt to reach in for a Grape Soda. Next came an ice cream cabinet chilled with mechanical refrigeration. A cylindrical copper fire extinguisher, veteran victor over past fires, hung on the South wall.</p>
 
<p>Front center had a "U" shaped island with cabinets holding cigarettes and other tobacco products on the inside, chewing tobacco, snuff, good to poor cigars, cigarettes, 20 &cent; per pack. On the outside, Butterfinger, Hershey, or Snickers bars: 5 &cent; and  Almond Joy, or Mound bars: 10 &cent;. Atop the island, a large cash register, bristling with a matrix of keys, topped with a pop-up-puppet price window, commanded commerce.</p>
<p>Either Clyde or Barton might ring up a sale. One time when Clyde and Barton were occupied elsewhere, I helped myself to a pack of cigarettes. While Clyde was indulgent with candy, sodas or ice cream, I knew neither he nor Barton would permit me to have a single cigarette, let alone a pack. </p>
<p>Jon Henderson and I kept the pack hidden at the cotton gin which did not spring into life until late autumn. For us, anxious to transition into adulthood, tobacco was one mark of that change. We worked furiously at the habit, some times as much as one cigarette per day.</p>
<p>Along the walls, allowing for aisles, wooden display cabinets held containers of staples like flour, salt, baking powder or steel canned vegetables, juices or fruit products. Transverse in the rear of the sales area was a chilled cabinet for displaying cuts of meat, a tray of hamburger and deli meats or cheese. Behind that a sturdy butcher table and a slicing machine that could slice impossibly thin. This was mostly Clyde's domain; one of the skills he picked-up was butchering.</p> 
<p>At slack times of business, which were common, Clyde might look expectantly toward the entrance his right hand in his pocket actively manipulating a stack of 6 or more half-dollar coins. With one hand he would flick the coin from the top of the stack to the bottom. Repeat, as if invoking commerce. But for Clyde, the social connection was as or more important. </p>
<p>Curtains gave way to the back third where cartons of un-shelved goods were stacked. Larger bags of flour stacked in back, had colorful prints on better cloth. A mother might chose the print she would use to make a shirt or dress for her child. I wore sack print shirts Mother bought from a seamstress, Mrs Olsen.</p> 
<p>Some times smoked meats hung in a special place. On week ends, brother Bob and or cousin Marynell might candle eggs with a bare light bulb in the manager's cubby. The cubby was originally lighted by a West window between the rear entrance and the South wall.</p> 
 
<p>In the manager's cubby a proud but wounded standing safe stood guard. Young thieves whose desperation equaled their dimness had knocked off the lock dial and bent the opening handle.</p>
<br>
<p>Years later, in the 1980's, Clyde and Homer, both retired, recalled their days running the Bronstad Store. The broken Bronstad Store safe commandeered their curiosity, and now their free time. They wrestled the safe onto a trailer, hauled it 100 miles to Clyde's garage and opened it up. Nothing of value found, but the shared expedition and effort were reward enough.</p>

<h3>Mrs. G. O. Bronstad Dies At Cranfills Gap </h3>
<p> Mrs. Laura Wilhelmina Hanson[sic] Bronstad was born of parents Hans Jergen and Petra Hanson[sic] December 11, 1873, at the old family homestead about four miles East of Cranfills Gap. She was baptized in infancy by the Rev. J. K. Rystad in Our Saviour's Lutheran Church at Norse. She was confirmed in the Lutheran faith by the same pastor and in the same church on June 23, 1889. On November 30, 1893, she was united in marriage to G. O. Bronstad at the old Rock Church near the old Hanson[sic] home. To this union were born six children, three sons, Otis and Clyde of Cranfills Gap, and Homer of Vernon; three daughters, Marie, Mrs. Chris Rohne, and Marguerite, both of Cranfills Gap, and Lorine, Mrs Douglas Hudson, of Holdenville, Oklahoma. Besides the above children she is survived by thirteen grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
</p><p>
She is survived by four sisters, namely Mathilda, Mrs. Thomas Jenson, Celia, Mrs. Emil Erickson, Martha, Mrs. Newman Hastings, and Mrs. Jennie Jermstad. She was preceded in death by her husband on July 18, 1937. Her only brother, Ferdie Hanson, died on June 12, 1942. Her oldest sister, Mary Gaustad, also preceded her in death May 21, 1949.
</p><p>
Grandmother Bronstad, as she became affectionately known in her family circle, passed away peacefully in her Cranfills Gap home, where she had lived for 57 years, at about 7:00 a.m. April 24, 1950, at the age of 76 years, 4 months and 13 days.
</p><p>
Mrs. Bronstad lived a life of deep Christian conviction and devotion to her church. She lived a life of complete surrender to her Saviour. She was sure in her faith and true to her Lord. In this assurance she lived a joyful life. The unselfish love for her family and friends will long be remembered. May god bless her memory.
</p><p>
Funeral services were held at the Bronstad home in Cranfills Gap, Tuesday, April 25, at 2:00 p.m. and at St. Olaf Lutheran Church at 2:30 p.m., with the pastor, Rev. B. R. Maakestad, in charge. The audience sang the hymn "Jesus Priceless Treasure" and the ladies' Chorus of the church sang, "I'm But a Strange Here" and "I Know of a Sleep In Jesus Name."
</p><p>
Chris L. Rohne spoke in behalf of the family and read the great number of greetings and memorials. There were also a great number of beautiful floral pieces.

On most visits to Clifton I haunted the college library where I gravitated toward the magazines <u>Life</u>, <u>Look</u>, <u>Time</u>, <u>National Geographic</u> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_(magazine)" target="_blank">Flying</a> &nbsp;<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i>, my attention drawn mostly to war planes of the West and of the Soviets. The Korean war was less threatening to us than WW II, but I feared Bob might be called up with his National Guard unit. (Clyde had urged Bob toward The National Guard as a better choice than risking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription" target="_blank">conscription.)</a> &nbsp;<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></p>  

<p>Brother Bob also sang as a choir member in Handel's oratorio. Memorably, Bob's college girlfriend, Joann Jones, sang a solo in her spare soprano. And of course, Mother expected Bob to come see her at some time during her brief visit to Clifton.</p>
<br>
<p>Aunt Annie Joy came all the way from Wichita Falls to support her sister's performance.</p>
<p>Sadly Clifton College could not sustain itself. Many years it buckled under changed economics, changed demographics, changed education, finally in 1954 it merged with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Lutheran_University" target="_blank">Texas Lutheran University</a> &nbsp;<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i> in Seguin, TX.</p>

<blockquote class="Cm2"><img class="mlr40px" src="../pic/Pinky/Walt-pinky.png" alt="picture Walt Bronstad"><strong>'Bronstad House' Hwy 22, in Cranfills Gap, Texas.</strong><br>(~1950 - 1952)<br>
<h4>Pioneer Housing</h4>
<p>The November move from "Homer's House" to the "Bronstad House" coincided with Maurice Bronstad being there; we'd joined the trailer loads of household items from the Homer to Bronstad houses. On the load with the spinet, he announced to me, in an older brother sort of way, that "Santa Clause" is not real. I'd sort of understood that but went along with the fiction because presents came with accepting the illusion. Don't mess up a good thing. And sure enough when Christmas 1950 came, it seemed much more modest. Many times later in life, I'd thought of a return revelation for Maurice: "God isn't real.", but never found the appropriate moment or sufficient cruelty of intent. </p>
<p>Bronstad House, what we called a pioneer home, was the most rustic home I'd lived in. Much draftier in winter, and hotter in summer. The bathroom was incomplete, having been an addition to the porch, it didn't lead directly inside the house, one walked from the bathroom to unenclosed porch to the door to the kitchen. There was only cold running water for the tub, no hot. Moreover, I was discouraged from using the flush toilet, rather I was urged to the outhouse uphill. The bathroom drained poorly, not having an adequate septic drain field. Leave the bathroom for the adults. My first bath in the house was in a 17 Gallon Galvanized Round Wash Tub placed close by the wood burning kitchen stove.</p>
<p>Clyde brought the brown enamel fuel oil furnace to heat the dining room; the pot bellied stove in the master bed room remained in service; it was hard to banish cold in such a drafty house. The wood fired kitchen range remained in the kitchen, redundant for cooking when Louise brought in an electric range, it was important to ward off winter's chill. </p>
<p>Aunt Margaret's white leghorn chicks lived some of the first weeks of their lives, warmed by the wood stove in the kitchen before they were mature enough to live in the chicken house in the back yard up the escarpment. </p><br>
<p>This was Margaret's house, the only house she'd lived in, the house where she cared for her Mother (Laura) until her Mother's death. How could Clyde's family just move in and take over? </p>
<p>There were family conclaves held in the Bronstad house after Laura's funeral where Laura's children confronted death's consequences. In play were parental assets, property, possessions and readjusted family obligations. A central obligation was Margaret.</p>
<p> Margaret never married. Margaret's schooling was abbreviated, she could read and often used her finger for a cursor. She could work and did the complex tasks of turning bacon fat and lye into home-made soap. She could turn home-made soap, kindling, windmill water, 25Gal. cast iron steel pot, "Mrs Stewart's Bluing", washboard and hand cranked wringer rollers into a steaming, outdoor laundry for the family. She could perform social roles in Lutheran Church and extended family ceremonies.</p>
<p>But I don't recall her holding down a paying job except for the money Clyde paid her for keeping the Clyde Bronstad home cleaned. (He hoped the payments could enable Margaret to have a minimal Social Security benefit, some measure of independence.) To my query about Margaret, Mother answered:, "She's Nervous.", an explanation from the 1920s. Today one might say, "mild Spectrum Disorder". In future others might observe that Margaret's Father, Gulbrand was 52 years old when Margaret was conceived and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paternal_age_effect?wprov=sfti1" target="_blank">older the sperm</a> the more likely genetic misfortune. "Nervous" works as well as any.</p>
<p>After Laura's funeral her children went home and Margaret joined her sister, Aunt Lorine, going home to Holdenville, OK. Lorine was the Nurse in the family, best equipped to deal with others in grief, best to insure Margaret's safety and security. Margaret had another stay with Lorine in August.</p> 
<p>In the family's conclave dealing with property and responsibility part of the resolution took the form of Clyde updating the Bronstad home with better electric service, hot water, a refrigerator, electric range and oil fired heat. (Mother was not going to retreat to living conditions like those of her childhood and hold down a teaching job at the same time.)
<p>"Taking over" Bronstad house was hard on adults, easiest for children.</p>
<p>For the first time, I had a room for myself, the boy's room, "inherited" from Otis, Clyde and Homer. One climbed up a part of the house unsure if it were stairs or a ladder into midday darkness if left and right doors were shut. To the right, the boy's room had a west window overlooking the drive-up and a south window overlooking the porch roof and egress via the aged cypress standing by the house. Many a night, needing to pee, I saw little reason to stumble in the dark, down a ladder, through a cold house to the cold three hole out house, just open the south window and wizz onto the porch roof &mdash; until &hellip; one morning, at breakfast, Father teased, "Wally, did you hear the rain last night?"
</p>
<p>Clueless, I said, "No, it didn't rain last night."
<p>The whole house enjoyed the joke as I slowly realized my urine would pitter-patter just outside Father and Mother's bedroom window. A loving mother bought me head to foot pajamas to help with the cold nighttime dash uphill to the three-holer.</p>
    <p> Uncle Chris Rohne, the town banker, must have had to foreclose on a non-performing loan, he had a small heard of sheep he grazed on Cranfill's Mountain. My first continuous job was feeding peanut hay to his sheep and closing them up safely for the night. Sheep, over time, revealed their individual personalities.</p>
<p> Bob bought me a Monogram model P40 Warhawk balsa wood kit, an Exacto knife, airplane glue, model airplane dope and tissue paper, starting a long line of model airplanes into my early teens. Most of the structure: ribs, spars, bulkheads, forms, struts, were just printed lines on 1/16" sheets of balsa wood. I had to coax the structure free of the balsa plank using the Exacto knife. The work helped me develop manual dexterity, focused attention, perseverance and, in the weekday absence of Bob, a degree of initiative and willingness to make mistakes.  </p>
    <p>If Dick Mapp visited around Christmas or July 4<sup>th</sup> fireworks were in order. We delighted in blowing things up. Bottles were forbidden because of the injurious shards left around, but tin cans were OK. Fun to watch an M-80 launch an empty bean can 30 feet into the air. Fun to bury a tin can into the ground, fill it with water, tie a rock to an M-80 and make an explosive fountain, still more fun to top the can off with a layer of gasoline and create a fireball. Fireballs were very brief and I think parents were not watching.</p>
<p>Without Dick, I found other uses for a firecracker. The wonderfully friendly owner of Rhodes and Tindall Hardware happily sold me a six inch length of 1/4 inch steel pipe. Ben Rhodes threaded one end and sold me a 1/4 inch pipe cap. Si Johnson, between customers at his filling station, drilled a 3/32" hole just at the point the cap screwed on tight. Clyde's handsaw, cut a handle from scrap wood and medical adhesive tape affixed barrel to handle. Carefully threading the fuse of a "Black Cat" firecracker from inside the barrel to outside charged my cannon. A steel ball bearing was the bullet. 
</p><br>
<p>Childhood friend, Jon Henderson, saw that the ball bearing penetrated 14 gauge sheet steel. I was quite pleased with myself, I was the only boy I knew with his own handgun. 
</p><br>
<p>Not so very long after Clyde returned from work for the weekend, my gun disappeared. And I was given to understand that I could not do that again. The community had engaged in rearing a child. Likely I owe Ben or Si as well as Clyde thanks for preserving my right (aiming) eye, for the pipe cap could have failed under the pressure.</p>	
    <p>  In rural Central Texas, we had no TV, but we did have the Viking Theater in down town Cranfills Gap. At 9 &cent; per ticket Father could let me go often. With a dime in my pocket, I would go on foot. To fan business, the owners held a nightly raffle spinning a wheel to determine prize value. One night I won a princely $36. Beyond my understanding, Father let Bob use $15 of my winnings to buy me a .22 Remington Model 514 single shot rifle and box of ammunition from Ben Rhodes. </p>
<p>On reflection, recalling the time Maggie found a copperhead chilling on top of a chest in the hallway Clyde must have pondered the weekdays he and Bob were away in Fort Worth. It would be good for the family in the Gap to have a little backup for those times when wild critters get too familiar.   </p>

<h4>1952-06-06</h4>
<p><mark>Mr and Mrs  Clyde Bronstad</mark>  and children, Wally and Bette, moved to Fort Worth Sunday, where Mrs. Bronstad enrolled at Texas Wesleyan College for the first summer session.</p>

<blockquote class="Cr2"><img class="mlr40px" src="../pic/Pinky/Walt-pinky.png" alt="picture Walt Bronstad">
<h4>South Fort Worth</h4>
<p> The lure of the city was strong for rural folk, education, housing, jobs and services  pulled strongly as surely did the rural pull of the familiar and the familial and fear of crime and loss of identity pull in the opposite direction.</p> 
<p>For Clyde and Louise the decision had been made months if not years earlier. We first moved to the  ~300 West Beddell Street house, not too far from Uncle Embrey's 3730 College Ave home. At the beginning of the move, I was offloaded to Uncle Homer's house where similar aged cousins Gorlyn, Maurice and David lived. So hasty was this step that I didn't have a change of clothes. Aunt Travis accommodated me from her stock of boy's clothing. My stay was extended as we visited Aunt Lorine in Holdenville, OK. for a few days.</p>
<p> Father continued to work at Carswell AFB, Mother had her own tasks: establish a new home, settle the younger children, enroll in TWC summer class and keep an eye on her oldest, Bob who was a Senior at Texas Weslyan College.
</p>
<p>Mother washed family clothes by foot in the bath tub, she was used to getting the job done with what she had.
</p>
<p> We attended TWC oil painting class, Mother took me along knowing I would pick up something useful. After one class, Mother and I walked across campus to the Student Center, to checked up on Bob - still rebounding from Joann's rejection. We found him being consoled by a coed in whose lap he lay, another accommodating coed standing nearby.</p>
<p>Seeing Mother, Bob almost snapped to attention; that National Guard Training had some use after all. Mother must have been a bit disturbed to find a seraglio at a Christian university. I was determined, on the spot, I was going to college!</p>
<p>Uncle Embrey's deteriorating eyesight had cost him his long standing job. He rebounded by selling life insurance, and he advertised by broadcasting sales brochures. Young boys were his distributors and I happily joined in delivering 100 circulars to front doors and earning 35 &cent;, &mdash; paid better than feeding sheep. Uncle Embrey taught me rudiments of urban navigation and map reading. That skill enabled me to go to down town or more distant movies by bus.</p>
<p>1952 was a presidential election year; Clyde bought a 14" Muntz TV so Mother could watch the Republican and Democrat national conventions, the children could be distracted and the family entertained in the evening. The Muntz name is now unfamiliar, but we got very familiar with the insides of the Muntz TV; many times over the few years of its use, we pulled many different radio tubes out to have checked at the local radio-TV store.</p>
<p>Mother found she could not enter the Fort Worth Public School system, local universities were turning out all the teachers that Fort Worth needed. She did find a teaching position in the Keller Independent School District, a rural district about 15 miles North East of Fort Worth. So we moved to 5011 Parrish Rd in Haltom City to minimize her commute.

<h4>1964-02-28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gunder Larson Dies In Clifton Hospital</h4>
<p>Relatives and friends throughout Bosque County learned with sorrow this week of the death of Gunder Larson, aged 77 years, 1 month and 6 days, of Cranfills Gap, at approximately 12:35 o'clock on Monday afternoon, February 24, in the Clifton hospital.</p>
<p>Mr. Larson became a patient in the hospital here on February 1 after he sustained a broken hip. He also suffered with a heart condition.</p>
<p>A son of the late Martin Larson and Mrs. Helene Foss Larson, Gunder Larson was born on January 18, 1887 on a farm in Hamilton County. When he was a small boy he moved with his family to a farm in the Boggy community west of Clifton where he was reared.</p>
<p>Mr. larson was baptized into the Lutheran faith in Our Saviour's Lutheran Church at Norse and later was confirmed in that faith in the same church. In later years, however he moved his membership to the St. Olaf Lutheran Church at Cranfills Gap which he faithfully attended as long as he was able. He attended the Boggy School near his home, Clifton Academy, and the Metropolitan School in Dallas.</p>
<p>It was on July 25, 1912, at Cranfills Gap that Mr. Larson married Miss Bettie Tergerson. Most of the years of their marriage they have spent at Cranfills Gap, where he has been employed by Bronstad's Store; the First Security State Band, a filling station, and a variety store. In earlier years he was an employee for a while with Waples Platter in Fort Worth.</p>
<p>Left to survive Mr. Larson are his wife, Mrs. Gunder Larson, of Cranfills Gap, one son, Wendell Larson of Austin, one daughter Mrs. Paul Christenson (Amy) of Cranfills Gap; two grandchildren Mrs. James Wethers (Paula Christensen), of Hamilton and Gwyn Christensen, of Plano, one great granddaughter, Sherry Lynn Weathrs of Hamilton; three brothers, Magnus Larson and Harry Larson, of the Boggy community and Louis Larson of Alamosa, California; and one sister, Miss Mary Larson of the Boggy community.</p>
<p>Mr. Larson was preceded in death by his parents, one brother, Ole M. Larson, and one sister, Mrs. Albert Anderson (Minnie).</p>
<p>Funeral services were held at 2:30 o'clock on Tuesday afternoon, February 25, at the St. Olaf Lutheran Church in Cranfills Gap and were conducted by Reverend G. C. Senff.</p>
<p>Pallbearers were William B. Bertelson, Wayne Rohne, Allen Bronstad, Jurgen Gaustad, <mark>Clyde Bronstad</mark> and Homer Hastings.</p>
<p>Interment followed in the St. Olaf Rock Church Cemetery between Clifton and Cranfills Gap.

<blockquote class="Cr1"><img class="mlr40px" src="../pic/Pinky/Walt-pinky.png" alt="picture Walt Bronstad">
<p>Sixteen years before Gunder's death, Father took me into Gunder's little dry goods store, next to Moody Green's Cleaners, on N Third Street in Cranfills Gap. There, Gunder and his wife welcomed us warmly; we had brightened their long wait amid a small stock of non-perishable, household goods. Clyde was making familial calls, introducing me to his second cousin. </p>
<p>I was a painfully shy child, so my r&ocirc;le in the meeting can not have gainful to the others there. Gunder was a well loved, kindly man; I must have gained by social osmosis the warm regard I feel for his name. </p>
<p>Moody Green's shop was another matter; it's tight confines were both his clean clothes hanging space, work space and, in back, his living quarters. Part of one wall was decorated with flint arrows and spear heads he'd gleaned walking the hills and escarpments about. Enough to chill a young boy with the prospect of Comanches returning.</p>
<p>Clyde skipped the pool hall; later I would waste many hours there along with other town children.</p>

Clyde attended the Cranfilis Gap public schools.  After completion of school at Cranfilis Gap, Clyde attended Howard Payne Academy in Brownwood.</P>
<P> Clyde was drafted into the army in World War I and received his training at Camp Mabry in Austin.  He served in the United States Army Balloon Corps. He was, trained to deliver messages on a motorcycle after receiving them from the observers in the balloon. He also received training as an automobile mechanic.</P>
 <P>After World War I, Clyde worked in the oil fields around Breckenridge. first as a carpenter building derricks and later as an automobile and truck mechanic. Clyde worked from time to time in his father's store. He often butchered steers and kept the neat counter stocked with fresh meat.</P>
 <P>In 1935 or 1936 a pretty young widow, <A href="Walton_Louise_M_Bronstad.html">Louise Walton Holbook</a>, and her four year old son moved to Cranfills Gap. Louise taught school at Cranfilis Gap and with her young son. <A href="Holbrook_Winnon_G(Bob).html">Bobby Holbrook</a>, lived at the Methodist parsonage with Brother and Mrs. Farmer. Louise and Bobby came into the Bronstad store one day and Clyde remarked to Louise "You've got a cute little boy there." Louise told Bobby, &ldquo;we'd better be going&rdquo; After this encounter, Clyde and Louise became friends, fell in love, and were married on July 19, 1936. </P>
 <P>To this union were born <A href="Bronstad_Gilbert_W.html">Gilbert Walton Bronstad</a> and <A href="Bronstad_Bette_L.html">Bette Bronstad</a>. On July 1986 Clyde and Louise celebrated their Golden Wedding Anniversary with a reception at the Hilton Hotel in downtown Fort Worth.</P>
 <P>In 1942, Clyde worked at Fort Hood near Killeen, TX. From 1943 to 1945 he worked in Waco at Blackland Army Air Field. The family moved back to Cranfilis Gap from Waco in 1945 where Clyde went in to the grocery business with his brother, <A href="Bronstad_Homer_H.html">Homer</a>, and then with Barton Pederson.</P>
 <P>In the early 50's Clyde went to work at Carswe11 Air Force Base in Fort Worth where he worked until his retirement.</P>
 <P>At age 87 Clyde and Louse moved to Germany and stayed with their daughter, Bette and her daughter Embrey for two years. During this time they toured much of Europe and Scandinavia.</P>
 <P>On August 16, 1989. Louise passed away. She had been his devoted wife for more than 50 years. She was a dedicated school teacher and artist in addition to being a housewife and mother.</P>
 <P>On Tuesday, December 26, 1989, Clyde passed way peacefully at Clifton Lutheran Sunset Home in his 93rd year.</P>
 <P>Clyde was preceded in death my his parents, G.O. and Laura Hansen Bronstad, by his brother <A href="Bronstad_Otis_J.html">Otis</a>, by his sisters, <A href="Bronstad_Marie_P_Rohne.html">Marie, Mrs. Chris Rohne</a>, <A href="Bronstad_Lorine_G_Hudson.html">Loraine, Mrs. Douglas Hudson</a>, and <A href="Bronstad_Marguerite_C.html">Marguerite</a>. He is survived by his brother and sister in law Homer and Travis Bronstad of Denton, by his sons W. G. (Bobby) Holbrook of Appleton, Wisconsin, and Gilbert Walton Bronsted of Austin, by his daughter Bette Bronstad of Fort Worth. grandsons Rex Holbrook, Mark Holbrook and Matthew Bronstad, granddaughters Terry Searle, Kris Bronstad, Kate Bronstad, and Embrey Bronstad, and, great grandson Shawn Searle and great granddaughter Jenica Searle.</P>
 <P>Born in the nineteenth century, Clyde enthusiastically welcomed the twentieth century. The automobile was a lifelong love; he took to it as naturally as a duck takes to water. In the eighth decade of his life he labored on an improved fluid coupling for automobile transmissions. During World War II and the cold war years, he did engine maintenance on military aircraft.</P>
 <P>He was a man of many skills. He could build a house - and he built several solid houses in Cranfills Gap and in the Texas oil fields. He could fix mechanical things and so for many years on the flight lines of Blackland and Carswell Air Force Bases.</P>
 <P>But most of all Clyde liked people. He relished the company of kin folks, friends, fellow Lutherans, fellow human beings. He approached all the world with a disarming simple honesty. He loved to bring laughter, to share laughter with his fellow man. I cannot remember when I did not know Clyde.</P>
 <P>Bronstad Store was the heart and soul of Cranfills Gap. G. O. Bronstad was the organizer and first president of the bank here at the Gap. Clyde's brother, Otis, married my Aunt Selma Tergerson, his sister, Marie married my uncle, Chris Rohne, his brother Homer married my cousin, Travis Knudson, his sister Lorine was my mother's classmate in nurse's training. His uncle Ferdie Hansen married my aunt, Mary Tergerson. His aunt <A href="./FGeng/JOF-B.html#&laquo;0.B-2&raquo;">Mathilda</a><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i> married Thomas Jenson whose sons married my aunt and cousin. His aunt, <A href="./FGeng/JOF-B.html#&laquo;0.B-4&raquo;">Celie</a><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i> married Emil Erickson whose grandson married my wife's cousin. Clyde's Uncle Chris married a Colwick who was my wife's cousin.</P>
 <P>I think I first met Louise and Bobby at a gathering at Bailey Johnson's home shortly after Clyde and Louise married. Bobby and I began the first grade together and finished together at Cranfills Gap High School in 1949. Clyde signed our diplomas as President of the School Board on May 27, 1949. It hangs on the wall in my office so his presence will always be near to me.</P>
 <P>I remember Clyde as a census taker in about 1940. I went along with him to open gates to our neighbors' places when he took the census in the Boggy community.</P>
 <P>I've visited many times in Clyde and Louise's home. Theirs was a home of love and laughter, a stable and nurturing haven for their family. Clyde and Louise gave of themselves to their family,their extended families and to the various communities in which, they lived. They have raised outstanding children.</P>
 <P>Clyde was a friend' to all who knew him. He had a great sense of humor and a great wit.</P>
 <P>Clyde was baptized and confirmed in the Christian faith of the Lutheran church. He and my mother and my Aunt Helen Jenson were confirmed at the Rock Church in the Norwegian language on June 2, 1912. Clyde remained a faithful member of that faith throughout his life.</P>
 <P>Clyde had a simple, quiet faith in God. It could be summed up in the words from one of our hymns:</P>
 <P><i>This is my father's world, and to my listening ears, <br>
  &nbsp;all nature sings and round me rings <br>
  &nbsp;the music of the spheres. </i></P>
 <P><i>This is my fathers world; I rest me in the thought<br>
  &nbsp; of rocks and trees, of skies and seas <br>
  &nbsp; -his hand the wonders wrought. </i></P>
 <P><i>This is my father's world, the birds their carols raise. <br>
  &nbsp; The morning light, the lily white<br>
  &nbsp; declare their maker's praise.</i></P>
 <P><i>This is my father's world; he shines in all that's fair,<br>
  &nbsp; in the rustling grass, I hear him pass,<br>
  &nbsp; He speaks to me everywhere. </i></P>
 <P><i>This is my father's world, O let me ne'er forget.<br>
  &nbsp; That though the wrong seems oft so strong,<br>
  &nbsp; God is the ruler yet. </i></P>
 <P><i>This is my father's world, why should my heart be sad<br>
&nbsp; The Lord is king, let the heavens ring<br>
&nbsp; God reigns, let the earth be glad.</i></P>
