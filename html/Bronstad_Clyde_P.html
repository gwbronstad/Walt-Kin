{From Wikipedia}<hr> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranfills_Gap,_Texas" target="_blank">Cranfills Gap</a> is a city located in Bosque County in central Texas, United States. It was founded by Norwegian Emigrants and to this day most residents can trace their lineage to those Norwegian Founders. The Bosque county area surrounding Cranfills Gap is listed on the National Register of Historic places as the Norse Historic District.[4] The population was 277 at the 2020 census.<br><br>
<b>History</b>
<br><br>
The area in which Cranfills Gap is located was originally settled by and named for George Eaton Cranfill in 1851.
<br><br>
Norwegian settlers in and around the community, who were mostly Lutheran, built St. Olaf Kirke (kirke is Norwegian for "church") in a rural area just outside Cranfills Gap. St. Olaf Kirke, commonly referred to as The Rock Church, is a small Lutheran church located in the unincorporated rural community of Norse, Texas. Among the pioneers in Norse was Cleng Peerson. The founder of Norse was Ole Canuteson (Ole Knudsen) from the Stavanger region of Norway. In 1917, as the congregation of that church began to grow, a new church was built for the congregation inside the town.[5]
<br><br>
The town slowly grew to its peak population of 600 in 1940. During World War II, Cranfills Gap was the first town to sell more than its quota of war bonds for the Fourth War Loan Drive. While as many as 25 businesses operated within "the gap", as locals commonly refer to it, the population and the business activity slowly dwindled to roughly nine businesses in 1980 and a population of 269 in 1990. 
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote class="gwb">The tempo of life in Cranfills Gap 35 years later seemd not much different; slower perhaps in the 1950's, given that there were relatively fewer young people in the 1950's to leven he community with the yeast of youth.<br><br>
The newspaperman, Jas H Knight, frequently took a jocund turn with his subject matter; this made the commonplace more readworthy. Sometimes however it is hard to know when reportage is serious and not jest.<br><br>
Case in point is the 1917-07-27 entry where Clyde is the assistant freight conductor.

{From Wikipedia}<hr> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" target="_blank">World War I</a>
or the First World War (28 July 1914 – 11 November 1918), also known as the Great War, was a global conflict between two coalitions: the Allies (or Entente) and the Central Powers. Fighting took place mainly in Europe and the Middle East, as well as in parts of Africa and the Asia-Pacific, and in Europe was characterised by trench warfare; the widespread use of artillery, machine guns, and chemical weapons (gas); and the introductions of tanks and aircraft. World War I was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, resulting in an estimated 10 million military dead and more than 20 million wounded, plus some 10 million civilian dead from causes including genocide. The movement of large numbers of people was a major factor in the deadly Spanish flu pandemic.
<br><br>&hellip;
The causes of World War I included the rise of Germany and decline of the Ottoman Empire, which disturbed the long-standing balance of power in Europe, as well as economic competition between nations triggered by industrialisation and imperialism. Growing tensions between the great powers and in the Balkans reached a breaking point on 28 June 1914, when a Bosnian Serb named Gavrilo Princip assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne. Austria-Hungary held Serbia responsible, and declared war on 28 July. After Russia mobilised in Serbia's defence, Germany declared war on Russia and France, who had an alliance. The United Kingdom entered after Germany invaded Belgium, whose neutrality it guaranteed, and the Ottomans joined the Central Powers in November. Germany's strategy in 1914 was to quickly defeat France, then to transfer its forces to the east, but its advance was halted in September, and by the end of the year the Western Front consisted of a continuous line of trenches stretching from the English Channel to Switzerland. The Eastern Front was more dynamic, but neither side gained a decisive advantage, despite costly offensives. Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece and others joined in from 1915 onward.
<br><br>
In April 1917, the United States entered the war on the Allied side following Germany's resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare against Atlantic shipping. Later that year, the Bolsheviks seized power in the Russian October Revolution, and Soviet Russia signed an armistice with the Central Powers in December, followed by a separate peace in March 1918. That month, Germany launched an offensive in the west, which despite initial successes left the German Army exhausted and demoralised. A successful Allied counter-offensive from August 1918 caused a collapse of the German front line. By early November, Bulgaria, the Ottoman Empire and Austria-Hungary had each signed armistices with the Allies, leaving Germany isolated. Facing a revolution at home, Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated on 9 November, and the war ended with the Armistice of 11 November 1918.

<a id="SpanishFlu">{From Wikipedia}</a><hr> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu" target="_blank">Spanish Flu</a>
The 1918–1920 flu pandemic, also known as the Great Influenza epidemic or by the common misnomer Spanish flu, was an exceptionally deadly global influenza pandemic caused by the H1N1 subtype of the influenza A virus. The earliest documented case was March 1918 in the state of Kansas in the United States, with further cases recorded in France, Germany and the United Kingdom in April. Two years later, nearly a third of the global population, or an estimated 500 million people, had been infected in four successive waves. Estimates of deaths range from 17 million to 50 million, and possibly as high as 100 million, making it one of the deadliest pandemics in history.
<br><br>
The pandemic broke out near the end of World War I, when wartime censors in the belligerent countries suppressed bad news to maintain morale, but newspapers freely reported the outbreak in neutral Spain, creating a false impression of Spain as the epicenter and leading to the "Spanish flu" misnomer. Limited historical epidemiological data make the pandemic's geographic origin indeterminate, with competing hypotheses on the initial spread.

<b>Roaring TwentiesI</b>
<br>
    The Roaring Twenties, sometimes stylized as Roaring '20s, refers to the 1920s decade in music and fashion, as it happened in Western society and Western culture. It was a period of economic prosperity with a distinctive cultural edge in the United States and Europe, particularly in major cities such as Berlin, Buenos Aires, Chicago, London, Los Angeles, Mexico City, New York City, Paris, and Sydney. In France, the decade was known as the <i>années folles</i> ('crazy years'), emphasizing the era's social, artistic and cultural dynamism. Jazz blossomed, the flapper redefined the modern look for British and American women, and Art Deco peaked.
<br><br>
The social and cultural features known as the Roaring Twenties began in leading metropolitan centers and spread widely in the aftermath of World War I. The spirit of the Roaring Twenties was marked by a general feeling of novelty associated with modernity and a break with tradition, through modern technology such as automobiles, moving pictures, and radio, bringing "modernity" to a large part of the population. Formal decorative frills were shed in favor of practicality in both daily life and architecture. At the same time, jazz and dancing rose in popularity, in opposition to the mood of World War I. As such, the period often is referred to as the Jazz Age.
<br><br>
The 1920s saw the large-scale development and use of automobiles, telephones, films, radio, and electrical appliances in the lives of millions in the Western world. Aviation soon became a business due to its rapid growth. Nations saw rapid industrial and economic growth, accelerated consumer demand, and introduced significant new trends in lifestyle and culture. The media, funded by the new industry of mass-market advertising driving consumer demand, focused on celebrities, especially sports heroes and movie stars, as cities rooted for their home teams and filled the new palatial cinemas and gigantic sports stadiums. In many countries, women won the right to vote.
<br><br>
Wall Street invested heavily in Germany under the 1924 Dawes Plan, named after banker and later 30th vice president Charles G. Dawes. The money was used indirectly to pay reparations to countries that also had to pay off their war debts to Washington. While by the middle of the decade prosperity was widespread, with the second half of the decade known, especially in Germany, as the "Golden Twenties", the decade was coming fast to an end. The Wall Street crash of 1929 ended the era, as the Great Depression brought years of hardship worldwide.<br>

<blockquote class="wiki">
{From Wikipedia}<hr> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression" target="_blank">The Great Depression </a> was a severe global economic downturn from 1929 to 1939. The period was characterized by high rates of unemployment and poverty; drastic reductions in liquidity, industrial production, and trade; and widespread bank and business failures around the world. The economic contagion began in 1929 in the United States, the largest economy in the world, with the devastating Wall Street stock market crash of October 1929 often considered the beginning of the Depression. Among the countries with the most unemployed were the U.S., the United Kingdom, and Germany.
<br><br>
The Depression was preceded by a period of industrial growth and social development known as the "Roaring Twenties". Much of the profit generated by the boom was invested in speculation, such as on the stock market, which resulted in growing wealth inequality. Banks were subject to minimal regulation under laissez-faire economic policies, resulting in loose lending and widespread debt. By 1929, declining spending had led to reductions in manufacturing output and rising unemployment. Share values continued to rise until the Wall Street crash, after which the slide continued for three years, accompanied by a loss of confidence in the financial system. By 1933, the unemployment rate in the U.S. had risen to 25 percent, about one-third of farmers had lost their land, and about half of its 25,000 banks had gone out of business. The U.S. federal government under President Herbert Hoover was unwilling to intervene heavily in the economy. In the 1932 presidential election, Hoover was defeated by Franklin D. Roosevelt, who from 1933 pursued a set of expansive New Deal programs in order to provide relief and create jobs. In Germany, which depended heavily on U.S. loans, the crisis caused unemployment to rise to nearly 30% and fueled political extremism, paving the way for Adolf Hitler's Nazi Party to rise to power in 1933.
<br><br>
Between 1929 and 1932, worldwide gross domestic product (GDP) fell by an estimated 15%; in the U.S., the Depression resulted in a 30% contraction in GDP.[1] Recovery varied greatly around the world. Some economies, such as the U.S., Germany and Japan started to recover by the mid-1930s; others, like France, did not return to pre-shock growth rates until later in the decade.[2] The Depression had devastating economic effects on both wealthy and poor countries: all experienced drops in personal income, prices (deflation), tax revenues, and profits. International trade fell by more than 50%, and unemployment in some countries rose as high as 33%.[3] Cities around the world, especially those dependent on heavy industry, were heavily affected. Construction virtually halted in many countries, and farming communities and rural areas suffered as crop prices fell by up to 60%.[4][5][6] Faced with plummeting demand and few job alternatives, areas dependent on primary sector industries suffered the most.[7] The outbreak of World War II in 1939 ended the Depression, as it stimulated factory production, providing jobs for women as militaries absorbed large numbers of young, unemployed men.

In a community like Cranfills Gap, very little went unnoticed. There were no Gestapo or NKVD spies earning their State Security keep, but there were neighbors who wanted to know which kin visited whom and where their neighbors had been the last two days.<br><br>
Such information did not so much stabilize the state as sell the local weeklies, The <u>Clifton Record</u> or the <u>Meridian Tribune</u>. To me, <u>The Clifton Record</u> offered richer ore. There seemed to have been more Norwegian ties between Cranfills gap (the Gap) and Clifton than between the Gap and Meridian.<hr>
<br>
Other expressions of this web of social interest were less beneficial. Religious tension extended into Clyde's home and hobbled household harmony. Louise was a committed Methodist and Clyde was a formally Confirmed Lutheran. Clyde and Louise wed not in Cranfills Gap's St Olaf Lutheran Church, but in a Lutheran Church in Waco. Surely they agreed on mutual acceptance, but the difference continually hampered harmony. Conflicting issues were often decided on the battleground of scriptural quotations. <br><br>
Each, Clyde and Louise, retained their religious affiliation to the end of their lives. They were finally united in their joint graves.

Clyde heated the living room with a massive brown, fuel oil furnace. The outside was enamel brown. I loved Crayola‘s. I loved the intense colors of Crayons but found them faithless. Yes, one could draw a line with the red crayon, but it had betrayed the  brilliance of the Crayola, the drawn line lost saturation. It was a disappointment.
<br><br>
But I discovered if one applied the Crayola to the heated, brown enamel surface, one could draw a line that retained the saturation of the wax crayon. This was wonderful; at last Crayolas fulfilled, their promise.
<br><br>
The smell of liquid Crayola soon got my parents attention; they came out of the kitchen into the living room, alerted by an unfamiliar smell . They cavalierly stopped my artistic endeavors with some incomprehensible warning about fire. I saw no fire, but stop I must.<br><br>
Later, I discovered my artistry could be out of view if I crawled behind the furnace on my belly, I might reached for Michelangelo‘s artistic height, though prone on the floor. The odour continue to give me away. Soon spring ended the need for heat and withdrew my miracle canvas.

<a id="WWII-Rationing">{From Wikipedia}</a><hr> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationing_in_the_United_States" target="_blank">Rationing in the United States</a><br>
<b>World War II</b>
<br>
    We discovered that the American people are basically honest and talk too much.<br>
    — A ration board member.<br>
<br>
In the summer of 1941, rationing in the United Kingdom increased because of military needs, and German attacks on shipping in the Battle of the Atlantic. The British government appealed to Americans to conserve food to help the UK. The Office of Price Administration (OPA) warned Americans of potential gasoline, steel, aluminum, and electricity shortages.[6] It believed that with factories converting to military production and consuming many critical supplies, rationing would become necessary if the country entered the war. The OPA established a rationing system after the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December.<br><br>
<b>Ration books, stamps, and tokens</b>
<br>
The work of issuing ration books and exchanging used stamps for certificates was handled by some 5,500 local ration boards of mostly volunteer workers selected by local officials. Many levels of rationing went into effect. Some items, such as sugar, were distributed evenly based on the number of people in a household. Other items, like gasoline or fuel oil, were rationed only to those who could justify a need. Restaurant owners and other merchants were accorded more availability, but had to collect ration stamps to restock their supplies. In exchange for used ration stamps, ration boards delivered certificates to restaurants and merchants to authorize procurement of more products.
<br><br>
Each ration stamp had a generic drawing of an airplane, gun, tank, aircraft carrier, ear of wheat, fruit, etc. and a serial number. Some stamps also had alphabetic lettering. The kind and amount of rationed commodities were not specified on most of the stamps and were not defined until later when local newspapers published, for example, that beginning on a specified date, one airplane stamp was required (in addition to cash) to buy one pair of shoes and one stamp number 30 from ration book four was required to buy five pounds of sugar. The commodity amounts changed from time to time depending on availability. Red stamps were used to ration meat and butter, and blue stamps were used to ration processed foods.
<br><br>
To enable making change for ration stamps, the government issued "red point" tokens to be given in change for red stamps, and "blue point" tokens in change for blue stamps. The red and blue tokens were about the size of dimes (16 millimetres (0.63 in)) and were made of thin compressed wood fiber material, because metals were in short supply.
<br><br>
There was a black market in stamps. To prevent this, the OPA ordered vendors not to accept stamps that they themselves did not tear out of books. Buyers, however, circumvented this by saying (sometimes accurately, as the books were not well-made) that the stamps had "fallen out". In actuality, they may have acquired stamps from other family members or friends, or the black market.
<br><br>
Most rationing restrictions ended in August 1945 except for sugar rationing, which lasted until 1947 in some parts of the country.<br><br>
<b>Tires, gasoline, and automobiles</b>
<br><br>
Tires were the first item to be rationed by the OPA, which ordered the temporary end of sales on 11 December 1941 while it created 7,500 unpaid, volunteer three-person tire ration boards around the country. By 5 January 1942 the boards were ready. Each received a monthly allotment of tires based on the number of local vehicle registrations, and allocated them to applicants based on OPA rules.[5]: 133  There was a shortage of natural rubber for tires since the Japanese quickly conquered the rubber-producing regions of Southeast Asia. Although synthetic rubber had been invented before the war, it had been unable to compete with natural rubber commercially, so the US did not have enough manufacturing capacity at the start of the war to replace the lost imports of natural rubber, moreover, wartime synthetic rubber was significantly inferior in quality to natural rubber. Throughout the war, rationing of gasoline was motivated by a desire to conserve rubber as much as by a desire to conserve gasoline.
<br><br>
The War Production Board (WPB) ordered the temporary end of all civilian automobile sales on 1 January 1942, leaving dealers with one half million unsold cars. Ration boards grew in size as they began evaluating automobile sales in February (only certain professions, such as doctors and clergymen, qualified to purchase the remaining inventory of new automobiles), typewriters in March, and bicycles in May.[5]: 124, 133–135  Automobile factories stopped manufacturing civilian models by early February 1942 and converted to producing tanks, aircraft, weapons, and other military products, with the United States government as the only customer.
<br><br>
A national speed limit of 35 miles per hour (56 km/h) was imposed to save fuel and rubber for tires.[11] Later that month volunteers again helped distribute gasoline cards in 17 Atlantic and Pacific Northwest states.
<br><br>
To get a classification and rationing stamps, one had to appear before a local War Price and Rationing Board which reported to the OPA. Each person in a household received a ration book, including babies and small children who qualified for canned milk not available to others. To receive a gasoline ration card, a person had to certify a need for gasoline and ownership of no more than five tires. All tires in excess of five per driver were confiscated by the government, because of rubber shortages.
<br><br>
An "A" sticker on a car was the lowest priority of gasoline rationing and entitled the car owner to 3 to 4 US gallons (11 to 15 L; 2.5 to 3.3 imp gal) of gasoline per week. "B" stickers were issued to workers in the military industry, entitling their holder to up to 8 US gallons (30 L; 6.7 imp gal) of gasoline per week. "C" stickers were granted to persons deemed very essential to the war effort, such as doctors. Motorcycles had D papers and motorcycle users who were essential to the war got "M" papers. "E" and "R" stickers applied to small and heavy highway machinery, respectively. "T" stickers were made available for truckers. Lastly, "X" stickers on cars entitled the holder to unlimited supplies and were the highest priority in the system. Clergy, police, firemen, and civil defense workers were in this category.[13] A scandal erupted when 200 Congressmen received these X stickers.[14] Referring to the lowest tier of this system, American motorists jokingly said that OPA stood for "Only a Puny A-Card."
<br><br>
As a result of the gasoline rationing, all forms of automobile racing, including the Indianapolis 500, were banned. Sightseeing driving was also banned. In some regions breaking the gas rationing was so prevalent that night courts were set up to supplement the number of violators caught; the first gasoline-ration night court was created at Pittsburgh's Fulton Building on May 26, 1943.<br><br>&hellip;
<br><br>

<b>Food and consumer goods</b>
<br><br>
Civilians first received ration books—War Ration Book Number One, or the "Sugar Book"—on 4 May 1942,[20] through more than 100,000 schoolteachers, PTA groups, and other volunteers.
<br><br>
Sugar was the first consumer commodity rationed, with all sales ended on 27 April 1942 and resumed on 5 May with a ration of 1⁄2 pound (8 oz; 227 g) per person per week, half of normal consumption. Bakeries, ice cream makers, and other commercial users received rations of about 70% of normal usage.[20] Coffee was rationed nationally on 29 November 1942 to 1 pound (454 g) every five weeks, about half of normal consumption, in part because of German attacks on shipping from Brazil.
<br><br>
As of 1 March 1942, dog food could no longer be sold in tin cans, and manufacturers switched to dehydrated versions. As of 1 April 1942, anyone wishing to purchase a new toothpaste tube, then made from metal, had to turn in an empty one.[5]: 129–130  By June 1942 companies also stopped manufacturing metal office furniture, radios, television sets, phonographs, refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, washing machines, and sewing machines for civilians.
<br><br>
By the end of 1942, ration coupons were used for nine other items:[5]: 138  typewriters, gasoline, bicycles, shoes, rubber footwear, silk, nylon, fuel oil, and stoves. Meat, lard, shortening and food oils, cheese, butter, margarine, processed foods (canned, bottled, and frozen), dried fruits, canned milk, firewood and coal, jams, jellies, and fruit butter were rationed by November 1943.[22] Many retailers welcomed rationing because they were already experiencing shortages of many items due to rumors and panics, such as flashlights and batteries after Pearl Harbor.[5]: 133  Ration Book Number Five is a very rare ration book, only issued to very few people.<br><br>
<b>Medicines</b><br><br>
Scarce medicines such as penicillin were rationed by triage officers in the US military during World War II.[23] Civilian hospitals received only small amounts of penicillin during the war, because it was not mass-produced for civilian use until after the war. A triage panel at each hospital decided which patients would receive the penicillin.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waco_Regional_Airport" target="_blank">Blackland Army Airfield, Waco, Texas</a><br>
<h4>History</h4>
Waco Regional Airport's history begins in 1941 when some grazing farmland was chosen for the new Waco Municipal Airport. Construction began in late summer 1941.[5]
<br><br>
In early 1942, the War Department leased the site and it was provided to the United States Army Air Forces for a training airfield. At the time, construction consisted of three runways partly completed. The Army Air Force began to rush the project to completion and changed the civil building plans to that of a military airfield and ground station. Barracks, mess halls, a hospital, church, theater, administrative buildings, aircraft hangars and a control tower were built. The facility was initially named China Spring Army Air Field and later Waco Army Air Field No. 2 before being renamed Blackland Army Airfield after the local black soil.[5]
<br><br>
Blackland AAF was activated on 2 July 1942, initially being a glider training school. The AAF brought a nucleus of experienced airmen from other airfields in the AAF Gulf Coast Training Center, and then civilian specialists were recruited from around the United States to supplement the military garrison. The civilian workers were instructed in Army aviation procedures and to fill hundreds of jobs necessary to support the pilot training program.[5]
<br><br>
In October 1942, the Army Air Force Pilot School (Advanced Twin-Engine) was activated (phase 3 pilot training). On 8 January 1943, the War Department constituted and activated the 33d Flying Training Wing (Advanced Twin-Engine) at Blackland and assigned it to the AAF Central Flying Training Command. The school used a number of two-engine trainers, including the Cessna AT-17 Bobcat, Curtiss-Wright AT-9, Beechcraft AT-10 Wichita, and TB-25 Mitchell.[5]
<br><br>
The school's mission was to train cadets to fly twin-engine transports and bombers in a nine-week course. During training flight training was combined with ground school classes including radio navigation, aircraft and naval identification, armament, photo interpretation, weather forecasting and other courses. Several hours of instruction were taught in the ground-based Link Trainers. Pilot wings were awarded upon graduation and were sent on to group combat training by First, Second, Third or Fourth Air Force. Graduates were usually graded as Flight Officers (Warrant Officers); cadets who graduated at the top of their class were graded as Second Lieutenants. &hellip;

<b>33rd Flying Training Wing (World War II)</b>
<br><br>
The wing was a World War II Command and Control organization which supported Training Command Flight Schools in Central and Northern Texas and Oklahoma. The assigned schools provided phase III advanced two-engine flying training for Air Cadets, along with advanced B-25 Mitchell transition training for experienced pilots for reassignment to other flying units. Air Cadet graduates of the advanced schools were commissioned as Second Lieutenants, received their "wings" and were reassigned to Operational or Replacement Training Units operated by one of the four numbered air fores in the zone of interior.[1]
<br><br>
As training requirements changed during the war, schools were activated and inactivated or transferred to meet those requirements.

It was memorable for having a barn style sliding door, and white walls decorated with green hand prints of Aunt Aubrey.<br> Mother thought it clever decoration, I think it Aunt Aubrey's affirmation of her own existence after experiencing the withering threat of tuberculosis before antibiotics.<br>Mother may have thought that too, but deferred trying to explain that to a child.

<blockquote class=" gwb ">The working yard of Mapp Tank Company was literally the side yard of the Mapp residence. Odessa was a strange land; distinctly arid. Trees hugged the houses, dependent on humans for water.  The working yard was filled with massive steel arcs of oil storage tanks awaiting relocation and assembly near remote field oil pumps.

<br>&nbsp;<br>Uncle Ernest was clearly more prosperous than we, he owned multiple flat bed trucks, a new Mercury automobile, and an 8mm projector. We watched Abbott and Costello features outside at night in the back yard.  </p>

<blockquote class=" gwb ">In the past, people were more attuned to entertaining one another with personally developed skills. The remarkably frugal Will Walton bought a piano for his home, presumably to enable the social development of his children. The same was true for the comparably frugal Gulbrand Bronstad who had a piano and a pump organ in his home.
<br>&nbsp;<br> In this case, the entertainment was for Cousin LoVerne's wedding.

<blockquote class=" gwb ">The Waltons travelled far less in the time of my memory. Presumably WIll’s faculties declined. Treatment for cataracts were relatively primitive. Ethel never learned to drive. Roadways from Hamilton to Cranfills Gap changed with the completion of Route 22, old pathways ceased after bridge maintenance on older bridges ceased.

<h4>1947-05-09</h4>
<p>In a deal that was consummated last week, Messrs. Clyde and Homer Bronstad, who since 1945 have operated the Bronstad Store as a partnership, sold their stock of merchandise to Dr. Clarence H. Johnson of Northfield, Minn. For almost 60 years there has been a Bronstad store in Cranfills Gap, and in Mr. Johnson there will be a worthy successor to the long established firm. Mr. Johnson also purchased the Homer Bronstad home and together with his wife and daughter, Enid, have moved into their newly acquired home.</p>
<blockquote class=" gwb ">Uncle Homer had served in the navy. After getting discharged, it seems he returned to running the Bronstad store in Cranfills Gap Texas. But it looks not like a promising business. 
<br><br>
When family patriarch, Gulbrand Olson Bronstad died in 1937, the Bronstad store (Bronstad and Son (singular!) would have been Uncle Otis's by right of primogeniture. Uncle Otis got out of the business in the late thirties preferring to be Gap Post Master. 
<br><br>
Uncle Homer, like Father Clyde had worked in the store, but Uncle Homer followed a path of teaching, pausing after a position at Blanket Texas. Following that he seems to have run the Bronstad Store from 1942 until he was drafted. I'm thinking that the family Matriarch, Laura Wilhelmina aided perhaps by her daughter Marie, wanted her younger sons to run the store, notwithstanding the shaky economic situation of too many stores for a town too small.

<p>Dickie Mapp of Odessa is spending the week visiting in the home of his uncle and aunt, Mr. and Mrs.<b> Clyde Bronstad</b>.</p>
<blockquote class=" gwb ">Dick Mapp was of ebullient spirit; he could spawn play of thin air and fright. Freed of the flat aridity of Odessa, he revelled in the more numerous Central Texas thunderstorms, excitedly watching nighttime lightening and hooking me on his love. He avidly explored the hills above town, getting us lost several times in the dense mixed Texas junipers and oaks.

<h4>1947-07-18</h4>
<p>In a deal that was consummated Tuesday of this week, Mr. E. A. Thompson of Hico sold his farm adjoining town to Mr. R. O. Blum, formerly being the Mrs. M. J. Mickelson place. </p>
<blockquote class="gwb">Clyde and family lived in the Blum house 1945–1947; it was wonderfully spacious, having more rooms than we could purpose. One or more upstairs rooms was locked, securing others' property, there was a sewing room in which very little was sewn.
<br><br>
In that house, I was first aware of being ill, spending nights on an Army surplus folding cot in the kitchen. Perhaps for warmth, perhaps for medicated steam. In that house, Bob suffered mumps in his adolescence: Dick and I were sternly warned to keep our distance, both to avoid disease and to avoid the wrath of an inexplicably testy Bob. In that house, new–born Bette came home as an infant, separating me from a Mother's attention.
<br><br>
In that house, for the better part of the summer, I owned Mother, all to my own, for Clyde and Bob were away in Kansas and states further North, earning money on wheat harvesting crew.
<br><br>
In that house, Mother taught me love of the pussy–willow catkins bulging day by day in spring warmth, until the slough of spring hail surrounded the house and shocked the pussy–willow into pause.
<br><br>
In that house, I now think, I witnessed a Mother making her nest for her new chick.

<p>Mrs. W. E. Mapp and children Dickie and Linda, of Odessa, accompanied by Mrs. Mapp's mother, Mrs. W. T. Walton of Hamilton, drove down Tuesday for a visit with their sister and daughter, Mrs.<b> Clyde Bronstad</b>. . . .</p>
<blockquote class="gwb"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Tie me up, Daddy</b><br>
Clyde and Louise took me along with them to movies in Waco. The newsreels told us of the progress of the war. I'd developed favorites among the cartoon features: Heckel and Jeckyl, Mickey Mouse, but especially Donald Duck.
<br><br>
The Viking theatre in downtown Cranfills Gap fed my love for cinema. With a dime, I could walk to downtown and get 1&cent; back in change after buying admission. 
<br><br>
Early fare was Westerns, and one frequent trope in the Westerns was the bad guys tying up the good guys. Lesson learned; any sensible person would practice untying really tough knots.So I demanded of my Father: "Tie me up, Daddy."
<br><br>
To my dismay, Clyde didn't seem to comprehend the existential significance. One must master getting untied. Eventually he relented and tied me up losely. Hah, mastered that.  "Tie me up better." &hellip;
<br><br>
And so on for a few iterations, until Clyde tired of the game and ended it by tieing me up for real. Endgame.

The front two-thirds began with two display window and a front double screen door. The windows might display perishable fruit like banannas or apples. Sometimes trace inducement schemes were displayed. A given amount of purchases might entitle one to a china plate or a gravy boat. The floors were pine, darkened from decades of sweeping the floors with a mixture of sawdust and kerosene after closing. There were 2 soda pop coolers, chilled with ice and an ice cream cabinet chilled with mechanical refrigeration. A cylindrical copper fire extinguisher hung on the West wall. Front center had an island with cabinets holding cigarettes and other tobacco products. Atop the island, a large cash register commanded commerce. Wooden display cabinets held containters of staples like baking powder or steel canned vegetable or fruit products. Tansverse in the rear of the sales area was a chilled cabinet for displaying cuts of meat. Behind that a butcher's block and a slicing machine. This was mostly Clyde's domain; one of the skills he picked-up was butchering.

<p>Mr. and Mrs. W. E. Walton of Fort Worth stopped in Cranfills Gap Sunday morning for a short visit with his brother-on-law and sister, Mr. and Mrs.<b> Clyde Bronstad</b>  en route to Hamilton for a visit with his parents, Mr. and Mrs. W. T. Walton.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. W. E. Walton and Mr. and Mrs. Otis Donahue and children of Fort Worth stopped in Cranfills Gap Thursday for a short visit in the home of Mr. Walton’s sister and brother-in-law, Mr. and Mrs.<b> Clyde Bronstad</b>, en route to Hamilton.</p>
<h4>1950-12-01</h4>
<p>Miss Imogene Silby, soprano, of Waco sang "Because" preceding the ceremony and Mrs.<b> Clyde Bronstad</b>, soprano, of Cranfills Gap sang Malotte's "Lord's Prayer" after which the wedding party had assembled at the altar. Mrs Casper Olson, organist of St. Olaf's Church, accompanied Mrs. Bronstad and also played the traditional wedding marches.</p>
<h4>1950-12-29</h4>
<p>Clifton College Auditorium was filled to capacity for the presentation of Handel's "Messiah" on Thursday evening, December 21. This was the first presentation of this musical treat in Clifton and it was very well received. Particularly well done were the solo numbers by Mrs.<b> Clyde Bronstad</b>, soprano; Miss Ruth Moore, contralto; Thomas Hardie, bass; Douglas Richards, tenor. These merited special attention. While some of the numbers were not so well known, all were well accepted by the audience, but the closing number, The Hallelujah Chorus, brought the most favorable comment of the Chorus groups.</p>
<blockquote class="gwb">Of course I had to attend. Many times had Mother and I taken the 18 mile, back country route from Cranfills Gap to Clifton, Mother driving the industrial-green '41 Ford coup&eacute;. (It also served her well years later when she drove from 5011 Parrish Rd in Fort Worth to her teaching position in Keller TX.) The weekly trip to Clifton was for Mother's voice lessons with Clifton College's Professor Rolf Espeseth. Professor of Music. 
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Brother Bob also attended Clifton Jr College, (He too sang as a choir member in Handel's oratorio. Memorably, Bob's college girlfriend, Joann Jones, sang a solo in her spare soprano.) And of course, Mother expected Bob to come see her at some time during her brief visit to Clifton.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Aunt Annie Joy came all the way from Wichita Falls to support her sister's performance. 
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Sadly Clifton College could not sustain itself. It buckled under changed economics, changed demographics, changed education.

<p><b>Clyde Bronstad</b>, who has employment at the Carswell Air Base at Fort worth, spent the week-end with his family.;</p>
<blockquote class="gwb">The Bronstad store closed one last time; jobs were in the city; that was where Clyde had to go. Until the whole family could move, Clyde stayed with Uncle Embrey and Aunt Pansy at 3730 College Avenue in Fort Worth. Bob left too; he went to Texas Wesleyan College in Fort Worth for his Junior and Senior college years. The city was tearing the family apart, family member by family member.<br><br>
Clyde and Bob's returns for the weekend, late, late Friday night, were a real treat; Clyde would bring back groceries unobtainable in the Gap. The "Chicago Bakery's" deep dark pumpernickel was worth the separation. Clyde demonstrated that a fresh slice of pumpernickle, a thin spread of butter and a thin spread of local Norwegian Gamalost (literally old cheese) was a delicacy. <br><br>
Dear Mother could never get her nose past Gamalost's goaty odor.  <br><br>
The Late Mark Johnson's departed Mother, Ina, was the last connection I had to Gamalost. And the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamalost" target="_blank">Gamalost</a> I bought in Norway, was no where near Gap Gamalost.

<H4>	Mr. Clyde Bronstad Dies			</H4>	
<P><A href="./SGeng/GO-D.html#&laquo;0.D-2&raquo;">Clyde Purnell Bronstad</a> was born on June 20, 1896 in Cranfilis Gap, Texas, to <A href="Bronstad_Gulbrand_O.html">Gulbrand Olsen Bronstad</a> and <A href="Bronstad_Laura_W_Hansen.html">Laura Wilhelmina Hansen Bronstad</a>, Clyde being the second of six children. Clyde's father, G.O. Bronstad' had immigrated to the United States from Norway in 1874 coming first to Waco and then to Valley Mills where- he lived for some time with his brother <A href="./SGeng/CO-C.html#&laquo;0.C&raquo;">Christian Bronstad.</a></P> 
<P>In 1887 G. O. Bronstad established a grocery store in Cranfilis Gap.
Clyde's mother. Laura Hansen, was the daughter of <A href="./FGeng/JOF-B.html#&laquo;0.B&raquo;">Jurgen and Petra Foss Hansen</a> - Danish-Norwegian immigrant farmers who lived near the Rock Church, a few miles from Cranfills Gap.
Clyde attended the Cranfilis Gap public schools.  After completion of school at Cranfilis Gap, Clyde attended Howard Payne Academy in Brownwood.</P>
					<P> 
Clyde was drafted into the army in World War I and received his training at Camp Mabry in Austin.  He served in the United States Army Balloon Corps. He was, trained to deliver messages on a motorcycle after receiving them from the observers in the balloon. He also received training as an automobile mechanic.</P>
 <P>After World War I, Clyde worked in the oil fields around Breckenridge. first as a carpenter building derricks and later as an automobile and truck mechanic. Clyde worked from time to time in his father's store. He often butchered steers and kept the neat counter stocked with fresh meat.</P>
 <P>In 1935 or 1936 a pretty young widow, <A href="Walton_Louise_M_Bronstad.html">Louise Walton Holbook</a>, and her four year old son moved to Cranfills Gap. Louise taught school at Cranfilis Gap and with her young son. <A href="Holbrook_Winnon_G(Bob).html">Bobby Holbrook</a>, lived at the Methodist parsonage with Brother and Mrs. Farmer. Louise and Bobby came into the Bronstad store one day and Clyde remarked to Louise "You've got a cute little boy there." Louise told Bobby, &ldquo;we'd better be going&rdquo; After this encounter, Clyde and Louise became friends, fell in love, and were married on July 19, 1936. </P>
 <P>To this union were born <A href="Bronstad_Gilbert_W.html">Gilbert Walton Bronstad</a> and <A href="Bronstad_Bette_L.html">Bette Bronstad</a>. On July 1986 Clyde and Louise celebrated their Golden Wedding Anniversary with a reception at the Hilton Hotel in downtown Fort Worth.</P>
 <P>In 1942, Clyde worked at Fort Hood near Kileen, TX. From 1943 to 1945 he worked in Waco at Blackland Army Air Field. The family moved back to Cranfilis Gap from Waco in 1945 where Clyde went in to the grocery business with his brother, <A href="Bronstad_Homer_H.html">Homer</a>, and then with Barton Pederson.</P>
 <P>In the early 50's Clyde went to work at Carswe11 Air Force Base in Fort Worth where he worked until his retirement.</P>
 <P>At age 87 Clyde and Louse moved to Germany and stayed with their daughter, Bette and her daughter Embrey for two years. During this time they toured much of Europe and Scandinavia.</P>
 <P>On August 16, 1989. Louise passed away. She had been his devoted wife for more than 50 years. She was a dedicated school teacher and artist in addition to being a housewife and mother.</P>
 <P>On Tuesday, December 26, 1989, Clyde passed way peacefully at Clifton Lutheran Sunset Home in his 93rd year.</P>
 <P>Clyde was preceded in death my his parents, G.O. and Laura Hansen Bronstad, by his brother <A href="Bronstad_Otis_ J.html">Otis</a>, by his sisters, <A href="Bronstad_Marie_P_Rohne.html">Marie, Mrs. Chris Rohne</a>, <A href="Bronstad_Lorine_G_Hudson.html">Loraine, Mrs. Douglas Hudson</a>, and <A href="Bronstad_Marguerite_C.html">Marguerite</a>. He is survived by his brother and sister in law Homer and Travis Bronstad of Denton, by his sons W. G. (Bobby) Holbrook of Appleton, Wisconsin, and Gilbert Walton Bronsted of Austin, by his daughter Bette Bronstad of Fort Worth. grandsons Rex Holbrook, Mark Holbrook and Matthew Bronstad, granddaughters Terry Searle, Kris Bronstad, Kate Bronstad, and Embrey Bronstad, and, great grandson Shawn Searle and great granddaughter Jenica Searle.</P>
 <P>Born in the nineteenth century, Clyde enthusiastically welcomed the twentieth century. The automobile was a lifelong love; he took to it as naturally as a duck takes to water. In the eighth decade of his life he labored on an improved fluid coupling for automobile transmissions. During World War II and the cold war years, he did engine maintenance on military aircraft.</P>
 <P>He was a man of many skills. He could build a house - and he built several solid houses in Cranfills Gap and in the Texas oil fields. He could fix mechanical things and so for many years on the flight lines of Blackland and Carswell Air Force Bases.</P>
 <P>But most of all Clyde liked people. He relished the company of kin folks, friends, fellow Lutherans, fellow human beings. He approached all the world with a disarming simple honesty. He loved to bring laughter, sto share laughter with his fellow man. I cannot remember when I did not know Clyde.</P>
 <P>Bronstad Store was the heart and soul of Cranfills Gap. G. O. Bronstad was the organizer and first president of the bank here at the Gap. Clyde's brother, Otis, married my Aunt Selma Tergerson, his sister, Marie married my uncle, Chris Rohne, his brother Homer married my cousin, Travis Knudson, his sister Lorine was my mother's classmate in nurse's training. His uncle Ferdie Hansen married my aunt, Mary Tergerson. His aunt <A href="./FGeng/JOF-B.html#&laquo;0.B-2&raquo;">Mathilda</a> married Thomas Jenson whose sons married my aunt and cousin. His aunt, <A href="./FGeng/JOF-B.html#&laquo;0.B-4&raquo;">Celie</a> married Emil Erickson whose grandson married my wife's cousin. Clyde's Uncle Chris married a Colwick who was my wife's cousin.</P>
 <P>I think I first met Louise and Bobby at a gathering at Bailey Johnson's home shortly after Clyde and Louise married. Bobby and I began the first grade together and finished together at Cranfills Gap High School in 1949. Clyde signed our diplomas as President of the School Board on May 27, 1949. It hangs on the wall in my office so his presence will always be near to me.</P>
 <P>I remember Clyde as a census taker in about 1940. I went along with him to open gates to our neighbors' places when he took the census in the Boggy community.</P>
 <P>I've visited many times in Clyde and Louise's home. Theirs was a home of love and laughter, a stable and nurturing haven for their family. Clyde and Louise gave of themselves to their family,their extended families and to the various communities in which, they lived. They have raised outstanding children.</P>
 <P>Clyde was a friend' to all who knew him. He had a great sense of humor and a great wit.</P>
 <P>Clyde was baptized and confirmed in the Christian faith of the Lutheran church. He and my mother and my Aunt Helen Jenson were confirmed at the Rock Church in the Norwegian language on June 2, 1912. Clyde remained a faithful member of that faith throughout his life.</P>
 <P>Clyde had a simple, quiet faith in God. It could be summed up in the words from one of our hymns:</P><i>
 <P>This is my father's world, and to my listening ears, <br>
  &nbsp;all nature sings and round me rings <br>
  &nbsp;the music of the spheres. </P>
 <P>This is my fathers world; I rest me in the thought<br>
  &nbsp; of rocks and trees, of skies and seas <br>
  &nbsp; -his hand the wonders wrought. </P>
 <P>This is my father's world, the birds their carols raise. <br>
  &nbsp; The morning light, the lily white<br>
  &nbsp; declare their maker's praise.</P>
 <P>This is my father's world; he shines in all that's fair,<br>
  &nbsp; in the rustling grass, I hear him pass,<br>
  &nbsp; He speaks to me everywhere. </P>
 <P>This is my father's world, O let me ne'er forget.<br>
  &nbsp; That though the wrong seems oft so strong,<br>
  &nbsp; God is the ruler yet. </P>
 <P>This is my father's world, why should my heart be sad<br>
&nbsp; The Lord is king, let the heavens ring<br>
&nbsp; God reigns, let the earth be glad.</P></i>
