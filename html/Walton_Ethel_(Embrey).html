  <div class="grid-context"><br><br>
    <p>Ethel's Father, James Monroe Embrey was from a long line of mobile southern American farmers ( Tippah, MS &lArr; Oglethorp, GA &lArr; Madison, KY.). dating back to a 1635 voyage to the New World. Henrie Emberie came on the boat, "America," in 1635, he may have been an indentured servant, he may also have been a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots" target="_blank">French Huguenot</a>.</p><br>
<br>
    <p>Ethel's Mother, Josephine Cameron or Camburn was of a moderately long line of Georgia farmers ( Rome, GA &lArr; GA &lArr; Scotland.). </p><br>
    <p>James Monroe Embrey was a Confederate veteran. Both he and Josephine Cameron/Camburn survived the destructive, disruptive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_the_American_Civil_War#War_Between_the_States" target="_blank">"War between the States".</a> In the aftermath of the war each was a refugee from their homes and families. </p><br>
	<p>Family stories describe how the Yankees (During Sherman's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_campaign" target="_blank">Atlanta Campaign</a>) took all the food at the Cameron/Camburn, Rome Georgia farm, killed all the chickens, even stripped the unripe peaches from the trees. Some malnourished children in the family died of childhood disease.</p>
<br>
    <p>Tossed by war's destructions and misfortunes, it is to their credit that James and Josephine could rebuild lives in the west (Central Texas). </p>
<br>
    <p>The added LDS Family search data show Aunt Pauline wed a <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/details/9JML-9JC" target="_blank">MR Daniel Riley McFatter</a> 1895-11-13 in Hamilton, TX. They had 3 children. I faintly recall grandmother Ethel Irene Walton speaking of the Mc Fatters with my Mother, Louise. Apparently Augustus H Berger was Mary Pauline Berger's biological father. Missouri records show that Josephine Cambern wed Mr Berger 1870 in Jackson, Missouri.</p>
<br>
	<p>James Monroe Embrey's Brothers, 
  	<a href="https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/sources/KL7Z-5SV" target="_blank">Benjamin Franklin Embrey</a>(b 1840) (Grandfather of Carl Rice Embrey), and 
	<a href="https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/sources/KNZ4-ZSR" target="_blank">Francis Marion Embrey</a> (b 1833)
	also settled in Hamilton County. On the 1900 census records, the Daniel R and Pauline Mc Fatter  family were close to the James Monroe entry, so presumably they lived close by.

<h4>1915-05-14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Child [Frederick Walton] Meets Tragic Death </h4>
<p> An accident which resulted in the instant death of Frederick Walton the little five year old son of Mr. and Mrs. <b>Will Walton</b> of Blue Ridge, occurred Wednesday afternoon at about 3:30 o'clock near the residence of W. O. O'Bannon, four miles from Hamilton.
<br><br>
The little boy was riding in a wagon in which his uncle, Tom Walton, was hauling a hay press. The child was standing near the press, when an upright lever caught in a low telephone wire, toppling over the press. It is supposed the child jumped from the wagon, the press falling out of the wagon on him, crushing him to death instantly.--<u>Hamilton Herald</u>. </p>
<blockquote class="gwb">Grandfather <b>Will Walton</b> said of Frederick,"We knew Fred was uncommon, he was always pleased with whatever we gave him or did for him. We had expected great things of such a disposition, but now he is gone."<br><br>The pain of this loss struck not only parents, siblings, Aunts and Uncles; the pain has become part of the patrimony of the next generation. <br><br>
Mother took care that I, as a child, then later as an adult visited <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/19979160/frederick-cook-walton" target="_blank">Uncle Frederick's grave</a>. (You can visit too, vicariously, by clicking the link.)

<h4>1924-10-03&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <b><u>Hamilton Herald-Record</b></u></h4>
<p> <b>W. T. Walton</b>, one of Hamiltor county's best citizens and a prosperous farmer, was a pleasant business caller in the Herald-Record office last Saturday afternoon. While here he informed us that his daughter, <a href="Walton_Annie_Joy_Walton.html" target="_blank">Miss Annie Walton</a> had returned to John Tarleton College in Stephenville for her last year in that institution. <a href="Walton_Aubrey_Gilkes.html" target="_blank">Miss Aubrey Walton</a>, who graduated from Tarleton last spring, will teach with her brother, <a href="Walton_William_E.html" target="_blank">Prof. Embrey Walton</a>, in the Shive school this year. This family of young folks are ambitious and are attaining to great usefulness in their school work, and a legion of friends wish for their continued success and happiness.</p>

<blockquote class="gwb">I get the impression of a man who was "bustin his buttons" with Fatherly pride. Wouldn't suffice to simply talk up his children to the fellows on the Hamilton courthouse square, or congenial congregants of his church. Nothing less than the entire literati in the reach of the <u>Hamilton Herald</u> would do. <br><br>
And it was quite an achievement for each sibling; homework hours were sandwiched between farm chores and the limited availability of kerosene lamps and oil for night reading light.<br><br>
And it was an achievement for Will and Ethel who could afford to send each child to school and continue to run the farm with a declining family work force.

Claibourne had to change church to Church of Christ to close the deal.</p>
<blockquote class="gwb">Well after Will's death in 1957, when the land was being divided among the siblings, Mother and I drove on the gravel road within the "ranch", land Will had used to graze cattle. It's an undulating section of land, covered in grass and live oak trees. At the 'top' of the section were rude shelter and feeder troughs. 
<br><br>
WIll would feed the cattle frequently throughout the week; that let him check on his cattle, to see if any were injured or in calf and other such work of herdsmen. The road hugged the fencelines, wherever terrain and live oak clusters permitted, so as to ease the job of checking the fence. 
<br><br>
But that day, Mother crept slower than usual along the rough rutted road, seeking Claibourne's shack. It took Claibourne long, isolated nights of wrestling with his soul before he could find a way to meet Leone's demand to change to her family's church.
<br><br>
At the time, I inferred Claibourne had built a retreat shack, but after having read Grace (Embrey) Eubanks account of James Monroe Embreys settling near Hamilton, " Later there were other small houses done on the ranch near Bear Creek--moving closer to town each time they were built", I now infer Claibourne squatted in an abandoned house/shack.

<blockquote class="gwb">The housekeeper, Esther Schneider, is a surprise. My guess is that the onset of Ethel's diabetes limited her. Thus she needs help keeping the household running. Ethel, suffering untreated diabetes, may not have been up to bringing in wood each morning to get the wood-fired kitchen range going. Milking the cow, churning butter, bringing in water from the windmill tank - all required work, unfamiliar in contemorary kitchens.
<br><br> 
Seven years after this census date, Mother and I visited her parents; after wakeing and eating, she took me along to the barnyard, showing me the potatoe patch below the barnyard. Papa Walton found fertilizing the potatoes with cow manure a distasteful idea, but clearly potato plants closest to the barnyard flourished best. She showing me how to milk a cow, how to carefully keep barnyard trash from the cow's flank and udder, out of the pail whilst her exertions filled the pail with squirts of milk. Thence to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butter_churn" target="_blank">plunger-churn</a> where more effort separated butterfat in gathering yellow balls from the milk. Later we went to the woodpile; while I was not instructed in use of the axe lest I remove a toe; I could carry in an armfull of split wood for the kitchen wood box.
<br><br>
Their niece Vivian Embrey is less surprising; she was making her way in the world and found temporary, familial assistance on her journey several times in the early '40's.

Now for the recollections: the first recollection, I would like to tell you about your grandmother, my great aunt Ethel. In 1960 I was a senior in college, doing my student teaching at Arlington Heights high school in Fort Worth, Texas. During the time I was doing my student teaching, I lived with Embrey and Beulah over on College Avenue in Fort Worth. Aunt Ethel came for a visit that lasted several weeks. (Emily was just a small baby). <br><br>Of course I had known Aunt Ethel for all my life, but I had never been around her for any extended period of time. At that time she must’ve been in her late 70s or early 80s But she was as much fun to be around as anyone my own age (21 at that time). We would go out to eat at colonial cafeteria and go shopping together and I hope that she had as much fun as I did. I can remember her telling me that when she was a child she rode a wagon pulled by horses, and that before she died, she hoped to ride on a spaceship to the moon. Her enthusiasm and love of life was infectious. --- Florence Ann Walton, Granddaughter of Florence (Embrey) Walton, a sister of Ethel (Embrey) Walton.
