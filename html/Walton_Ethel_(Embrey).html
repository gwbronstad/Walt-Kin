    <p>Ethel's Father, James Monroe Embrey was from a long line of mobile southern American farmers ( Tippah, MS &lArr; Oglethorp, GA &lArr; Madison, KY.). dating back to a 1635 voyage to the New World. Henrie Emberie came on the boat, "America," in 1635, he may have been an indentured servant, he may also have been a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots" target="_blank">French Huguenot</a>.</p><br>
<br>
    <p>Ethel's Mother, Josephine Cameron or Camburn was of a moderately long line of Georgia farmers ( Rome, GA &lArr; GA &lArr; Scotland.). </p><br>
    <p>James Monroe Embrey was a Confederate veteran. Both he and Josephine Cameron/Camburn survived the destructive, disruptive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_the_American_Civil_War#War_Between_the_States" target="_blank">"War between the States".</a> In the aftermath of the war each was a refugee from their homes and families. </p><br>
	<p>Family stories describe how the Yankees (During Sherman's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_campaign" target="_blank">Atlanta Campaign</a>) took all the food at the Cameron/Camburn, Rome Georgia farm, killed all the chickens, even stripped the unripe peaches from the trees. Some malnourished children in the family died of childhood disease.</p>
<br>
    <p>Tossed by war's destructions and misfortunes, it is to their credit that James and Josephine could rebuild lives in the west (Central Texas). </p>
<br>
    <p>The added LDS Family search data show Aunt Pauline wed a <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/details/9JML-9JC" target="_blank">MR Daniel Riley McFatter</a> 1895-11-13 in Hamilton, TX. They had 3 children. I faintly recall grandmother Ethel Irene Walton speaking of the Mc Fatters with my Mother, Louise. Apparently Augustus H Berger was Mary Pauline Berger's biological father. Missouri records show that Josephine Cambern wed Mr Berger 1870 in Jackson, Missouri.</p>

<h4>1915-05-14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Child [Frederick Walton] Meets Tragic Death </h4>
<p> An accident which resulted in the instant death of Frederick Walton the little five year old son of Mr. and Mrs. <b>Will Walton</b> of Blue Ridge, occurred Wednesday afternoon at about 3:30 o'clock near the residence of W. O. O'Bannon, four miles from Hamilton.
<br><br>
The little boy was riding in a wagon in which his uncle, Tom Walton, was hauling a hay press. The child was standing near the press, when an upright lever caught in a low telephone wire, toppling over the press. It is supposed the child jumped from the wagon, the press falling out of the wagon on him, crushing him to death instantly.--<u>Hamilton Herald</u>. </p>
<blockquote class="gwb">Grandfather <b>Will Walton</b> said of Frederick,"We knew Fred was uncommon, he was always pleased with whatever we gave him or did for him. We had expected great things of such a disposition, but now he is gone."<br><br>The pain of this loss struck not only parents, siblings, Aunts and Uncles; the pain has become part of the patrimony of the next generation. <br><br>
Mother took care that I, as a child, then later as an adult visited <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/19979160/frederick-cook-walton" target="_blank">Uncle Frederick's grave</a>. (You can visit too, vicariously, by clicking the link.)

<h4>1924-10-03&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <b><u>Hamilton Herald-Record</b></u></h4>
<p> <b>W. T. Walton</b>, one of Hamiltor county's best citizens and a prosperous farmer, was a pleasant business caller in the Herald-Record office last Saturday afternoon. While here he informed us that his daughter, <a href="Walton_Annie_Joy_Walton.html" target="_blank">Miss Annie Walton</a> had returned to John Tarleton College in Stephenville for her last year in that institution. <a href="Walton_Aubrey_Gilkes.html" target="_blank">Miss Aubrey Walton</a>, who graduated from Tarleton last spring, will teach with her brother, <a href="Walton_William_E.html" target="_blank">Prof. Embrey Walton</a>, in the Shive school this year. This family of young folks are ambitious and are attaining to great usefulness in their school work, and a legion of friends wish for their continued success and happiness.</p>

<blockquote class="gwb">I get the impression of a man who was "bustin his buttons" with Fatherly pride. Wouldn't suffice to simply talk up his children to the fellows on the Hamilton courthouse square, or congenial congregants of his church. Nothing less than the entire literati in the reach of the <u>Hamilton Herald</u> would do. <br><br>
And it was quite an achievement for each sibling; homework hours were sandwiched between farm chores and the limited availability of kerosene lamps and oil for night reading light.<br><br>
And it was an achievement for Will and Ethel who could afford to send each child to school and continue to run the farm with a declining family work force. 
</blockquote>
<h4>1935</h4>
<p>Ethel Walton's youngest sister, Great Aunt Grace Embrey (1899 - 1990) wed (16 June 1917)  Leonard Aubrey Eubanks (27 September 1897-22 October 1934, Breckenridge, Stephens, Texas)</p>
<p>L. A. Eubanks was chief Engineer of Brooks Gasoline Plant, he died of heart exhaustion, pheumonia + toxemia from accidental burns covering 1/3 of his body.</P>

<p>A desperate Grace had children ages 4, 8, 10, 13, 14 and 15. Some (all?) of them were routed among relatives for care and sustenance. These children were Ethyl Walton's nieces and nephews. Anetha Jean Eubank, the 13 year old, whom we later knew as Dink told us she and the other children hated it when it was time to live with Will and Ethyl. Ethyl was an awful cook and Will Walton a stern disciplinarian; they had to eat all their food.</P>
<blockquote class="gwb">Some families migrated westward as near family units. Most of the family of my Great Grandfather Bronstad from Hedemarken, Norway eventually came, in 3 or more traveling groups, to the Norwegian area of Bosque County, TX. Most of Claiborne Walton's children came with him from Kentucky to Hamilton County, TX. Some of James Monroe Cameron's brothers come from Tippah, Mississippi to join him in Hamilton, Texas. <br><br>In familial union, more could be done; in times of crisis, help was at hand, children were cared for. <br><br>
