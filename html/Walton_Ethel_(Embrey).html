    <p>Ethel's Father, James Monroe Embrey was from a long line of mobile southern American farmers ( Tippah, MS &lArr; Oglethorp, GA &lArr; Madison, KY.). dating back to a 1635 voyage to the New World. Henrie Emberie came on the boat, "America," in 1635, he may have been an indentured servant, he may also have been a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenots" target="_blank">French Huguenot</a><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i>.</p><br>
<br>
    <p>Ethel's Mother, Josephine Cameron or Camburn was of a moderately long line of Georgia farmers ( Rome, GA &lArr; GA &lArr; Scotland.). </p><br>
    <p>James Monroe Embrey was a Confederate veteran. Both he and Josephine Cameron/Camburn survived the destructive, disruptive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_the_American_Civil_War#War_Between_the_States" target="_blank">"War between the States".</a><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i> In the aftermath of the war each was a refugee from their homes and families. </p><br>
	<p>Family stories describe how the Yankees (During Sherman's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_campaign" target="_blank">Atlanta Campaign</a><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i>) took all the food at the Cameron/Camburn, Rome Georgia farm, killed all the chickens, even stripped the unripe peaches from the trees. Some malnourished children in the family died of childhood disease.</p>
<br>
    <p>Tossed by war's destructions and misfortunes, it is to their credit that James and Josephine could rebuild lives in the west (Central Texas). </p>
<br>
    <p>The added LDS Family search data show Aunt Pauline wed a <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/details/9JML-9JC" target="_blank">MR Daniel Riley McFatter</a><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i> 1895-11-13 in Hamilton, TX. They had 3 children. I faintly recall grandmother Ethel Irene Walton speaking of the Mc Fatters with my Mother, Louise. Apparently Augustus H Berger was Mary Pauline Berger's biological father. Missouri records show that Josephine Cambern wed Mr Berger 1870 in Jackson, Missouri.</p>
<br>
	<p>James Monroe Embrey's Brothers, 
  	<a href="https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/sources/KL7Z-5SV" target="_blank">Benjamin Franklin Embrey</a><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i>(b 1840) (Grandfather of Carl Rice Embrey), and 
	<a href="https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/sources/KNZ4-ZSR" target="_blank">Francis Marion Embrey</a><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i> (b 1833)
	also settled in Hamilton County. On the 1900 census records, the Daniel R and Pauline Mc Fatter  family were close to the James Monroe entry, so presumably they lived close by.


<blockquote class="Cr1 mmrg mpad"><h4>&nbsp;<img class="mlr"  src="../pic/Pinky/GraceEmbrey-pinky.png" alt="picture Grace Eubanks">&nbsp;AUNT GRACE RECALLS HER PARENTS,</h4>

1972–07–21
<br><br>
These things were subjects Papa [James Monroe Embrey] seldom ever mentioned, so what I can tell you is what mama [Josephine Cameron] told me. 
<br><br>
I remember well about the evening the northern soldiers came up the little road to their house. I remember well because it was still so clear and frightening to mama, who was a child. They were rude, cruel, and filthy. They killed a small white kitten that was playing in the yard, it belonged to mama‘s two little sisters. They caught and killed all their chickens, - all but one little brown hen sitting under a loose board in the floor of a shed roosting, they just couldn’t find her was the reason. 
<br><br>
They went through the house, taking all food and medicine; though their little orchard, stripping the trees of fruit, ripe or green, also cutting the trees down.
<br><br>
Later, both little sisters died from measles from lack of warmth, food and medication. 
<br><br>
[Before the above happened] Mama‘s father and two brothers were forced into service for the south - her mother never saw or heard from any of them again (I never knew any of my grandparents, never knew where they were buried) she (Grandmother Cameron) used to stand by the gate (where it once was) and watch, wait and worry, but they never returned. 
<br><br>
Mama (Josephine Cameron) was given to a friend of her mother’s that was going to live with relatives in Kansas City. Mama went to be nurse maid to this ladie’s small child for her room & board - she later took measles & pneumonia and almost died, the measles settled in her eyes and she never recovered from the effect.
<br><br>
Grandmother, Cameron went to work for her room and board from her people who still had a home or part of one. She never saw her family again.
<br><br>
From what mama told me, papa was from a fairly wealthy family - he never had to work.- never did work of the simplest kind, not even bring in wood - the young people spent most of their time at all night, dances and breakfasts at the home of the host & hostess. [had many horses – Papa loved horses]
<br><br>
Jesse had to write a theme in her Jesse schoolwork one time as I remember it – I am not positive except the reason, but I do remember Papa sitting before the wood-burning stove at night - and I usually sat in his lap and played like bears lived in his beard and whiskers and over the mountains through the woods, which was his beard and hair. He always seemed to enjoy this game as much as I did; but the following is part of what he told us one night – (for Jesse‘s school assignment). As I am sure you know Papa was in the cavalry And slept many a night with his saddle for his pillow and supper & breakfast were crackers they knocked the worms off of.
<br><br>
He left Mississippi on his horse in order to save his life from the Yankees and rode alone, a young boy yet, to Texas – one night it was storming raining blowing a terrible night. I do not know what state he was in, but he was very tired and very hungry, and he saw a tiny light deep in the woods Must have been huge trees and thick - but he realized he must have help because he could not go any much longer as he was – so he went slowly to the door and called out – after a wait of an awfully long time it seemed to him a man open the door slowly and only slightly - with a gun in his hand – (can’t tell in detail here) but the man let him in and let him sit before the fire to warm and partly dry – seemed he gave him a few bites of food only - then he shut him into a small back room with only the one door opening into the room, where the man was.
<br><br>
Papa said neither of them slept all night - he was sure - he knew he didn’t and every time he peeked through the crack the door, the man was sitting with his gun across his lap - staring at the door to Papa‘s room (they were both afraid of each other.) Papa was made to leave early and without food.
<br><br>
Mama’s home was in Macon, Georgia - where “Gone with the Wind” was written about as I’m sure you know, but I never remember Papa giving his hometown – Papa seemed happiest (as I grew older) to sit in a certain cain bottom chair leaning back against the outside wall (nights) me on the front steps - telling me about the “Big Dipper” the “Big Bear” - the North star and many more – while Jesse played the piano inside by the lamp light - these memories are strong, clear and real to me.
<br><br>
It really took an effort on my part to write these things they bring back too much! 
<br><br>
I hope there will be some help to you and please let Louise read this  and Aubrey and Embrey if they care to, but I believe they would be especially important to Louise. 
<br><br>
Perhaps sometime when I feel stronger, I might be able to add a little more but not at this time 
<br><br>
I am always glad to hear from you and yours and the best to you always -
<br><br>
With my love, 
<br><br>
 Aunt Grace [Grace (Embrey) Eubanks]

<p> An accident which resulted in the instant death of Frederick Walton the little five year old son of <mark>Mr. and Mrs. Will Walton</mark> of Blue Ridge, occurred Wednesday afternoon at about 3:30 o'clock near the residence of W. O. O'Bannon, four miles from Hamilton.
<br><br>
The little boy was riding in a wagon in which his uncle, Tom Walton, was hauling a hay press. The child was standing near the press, when an upright lever caught in a low telephone wire, toppling over the press. It is supposed the child jumped from the wagon, the press falling out of the wagon on him, crushing him to death instantly.--<u>Hamilton Herald</u>. </p>
<blockquote class="Cy2"><img class="mlr"  src="../pic/Pinky/Walt-pinky.png" alt="picture Walt Bronstad">&nbsp;&nbsp;Grandfather <b>Will Walton</b> said of Frederick,"We knew Fred was uncommon, he was always pleased with whatever we gave him or did for him. We had expected great things of such a disposition, but now he is gone."<br><br>The pain of this loss struck not only parents, siblings, Aunts and Uncles; the pain has become part of the patrimony of the next generation. <br><br>

<blockquote class="Cy1"><h4>&nbsp;<img class="mlr"  src="../pic/Pinky/Embrey-pinky.png" alt="picture Embrey Walton">&nbsp;W. E. WALTON FAMILY</h4>
[I spe]nt most of the first quarter, Twentieth century, in Hamilton County. I had diptheria during babyhood and Dr Jas [?] administered toxin-antitoxin; [?]dly the first used in the county. 
[?]v buildings erected on the square [?]e square paved by a huge horse-[powered] rock crusher. There were phonographs-and motorcycles before electric [lights and] indoor plumbing, telephones, w[indow] screens were commonplace. [fin]ally cars, then trucks, replaced bug[gies and h]acks, surreys and wagons; then gas [station]s and garages superseded livery [stables] and blacksmith shops. Roads were [improv]ed consistently.
<br><br>
[I was]thrilled by the first railroad from [Gates]ville: awed by dynamite blasts and [bridge]s as more tracks were constructed [between G]atesville and Comanche. Soon after [the las]t track was built, a big rain washed [out a s]mall bridge a few blocks north of the [Hamilt}on station. The first rail worker fatal[ity the] first car-train death in the county, I [?]  happened within two miles of my [?]bd home.
<br><br>
Haley's comet was a familiar sight in [the night.] I wondered if I might see its next [appear]ance (due 1986). A one-day excur[sion to] Waco's Cotton Palace was exciting. [The fir]st airplane I saw was piloted by [?]n Stinson during a carnival picnic [?]ly. Circuses in the fall were interest[ing, fi]shing and hunting, when it was too cold for field work, play at school [ and so]metimes a family picnic, constituted [most o]f our recreation.
<br><br>
[Som]etimes from home, a few miles [north] east of Hamilton, a heavy pall of [smoke]from four cotton gins, two cotton [seed o]il mills, a compress, flour mill, etc. [gave th]e town an industrial appearance, or [warne]d us for an approaching "Blue Norther".
<br><br>
[We] were thrilled by music of visiting U.S. [Army] and plane training flights after war [was d]eclared, April 1917. We rejoiced in [the ar]mistice celebration in 1918 and then [were s]addened within the next few months by many flu deaths.
<br><br>
[In th]e fall of 1918 we could see light from [a bur]ning oil well near Desdemonia, [in Coma]nche County. Soon many giant [wood]en derricks sprang up in the county [?]e in oil searching - no concern for [?]en. The wonder of radio followed [quickly.]
<br><br>
[On] May 5, 1915, the tragic death of my [broth]er. Frederick, age five, distressed us [esp]ecially my parents. One consolation [was i]n the words of King David, "I cannot [bring] him back but can go to him". Little [thought] now that forty-two years later I would [lose th]e only son I had at that time, Embrey. [?]nd again be consoled as before plus [grant]ded assurance gained through years of Bible study.
<br><br>
[Aft]er fifty-two years in Fort Worth, Hamil[ton is still "Home". My parents were Wm and Ethel Walton. My first wife and I had three children, Janetha. Embry. Jr. and Nan.  Alter my tirst wife's death I married Beulah and we have Emily and Paul. All five have enviable records of which I am very proud. I also have four grandchildren and [?]great-grandchildren. I have four sisters, Aubrey, Annie, Louise, and Ina. W. E. Walton.

<p> <mark>W. T. Walton</mark>, one of Hamiltor county's best citizens and a prosperous farmer, was a pleasant business caller in the Herald-Record office last Saturday afternoon. While here he informed us that his daughter, <a href="Walton_Annie_Joy_Walton.html" target="_blank">Miss Annie Walton</a> had returned to John Tarleton College in Stephenville for her last year in that institution. <a href="Walton_Aubrey_Gilkes.html" target="_blank">Miss Aubrey Walton</a>, who graduated from Tarleton last spring, will teach with her brother, <a href="Walton_William_E.html" target="_blank">Prof. Embrey Walton</a>, in the Shive school this year. This family of young folks are ambitious and are attaining to great usefulness in their school work, and a legion of friends wish for their continued success and happiness.</p>

<blockquote class="Cg2"><img class="mlr"  src="../pic/Pinky/Walt-pinky.png" alt="picture Walt Bronstad">&nbsp;&nbsp;This man was "bustin his buttons" with Fatherly pride. Wouldn't suffice to simply talk up his children to the fellows on the Hamilton courthouse square, or congenial congregants of his church. Nothing less than the entire literati in the reach of the <u>Hamilton Herald</u> would do. <br><br>
And it <u>was</u> quite an achievement for each sibling; homework hours were sandwiched between farm chores and the limited availability of kerosene lamps and oil for night reading light.<br><br>
And it <u>was</u> an achievement for Will and Ethel who could afford to send each child to school and continue to run the farm with a declining family work force.

Claibourne had to change church to Church of Christ to close the deal.</p>
 <blockquote class="Cg2"><img class="mlr" src="../pic/Pinky/Walt-pinky.png" alt="picture Walt Bronstad">&nbsp;&nbsp; Well after Will's death in 1957, when the land was being divided among the siblings, Mother and I drove on the gravel road within the "ranch", land Will had used to graze cattle. It's an undulating section of land, covered in grass and live oak trees. At the 'top' of the section were rude shelter and feeder troughs. 
<br><br>
WIll would feed the cattle frequently throughout the week; that let him check on his cattle, to see if any were injured or in calf and other such work of stockmen. The road hugged the fencelines, wherever terrain and live oak clusters permitted, so as to ease the job of checking and fixing the fences. 
<br><br>
But that day, Mother crept slower than usual along the rough rutted road, seeking Claibourne's shack. It took Claibourne long, isolated nights of wrestling with his soul before he could find a way to meet Leone's demand to change to her family's church.
<br><br>
At the time, I inferred Claibourne had built a retreat shack, but after having read Grace (Embrey) Eubanks account of James Monroe Embreys settling near Hamilton, " Later there were other small houses done on the ranch near Bear Creek--moving closer to town each time they were built", I now infer Claibourne squatted in an abandoned house/shack.
<br><br>
Regardless of the theological choices consequences on Claibourne's soul, it's a damned good thing Claibourne made the choice he did for the sake of Winston and Cynthia Dawn Walton.

 <h4>The Walton‘s family garden scarecrow.</h4>
<br>
Big Whitey had hardly crowded his shrill “cock-a-doodle-doo“ from that stout leghorn neck when William Twyman Walton opened his big blue eyes and bounded to the floor, exclaiming "Gosh-o-landin', Ethel, like brother Barret would say, I should have been up an hour ago.
<br><br>
One of Will's chief delights was to relate a humorous incident or one that evoked pleasure. So he smiled to himself as he anticipated the day's plowing, while lighting the kindling and wood in the cook stove as he listened intermittently to the "potrack" of the guineas and gobble of the turkeys, hoping that some noise from Ethel, Embrey, Aubrey, Annie Joy, Louise, or Ina would announce other awakenings.
<br><br>
He reminisced about the cattle drives that he and other cowboys made to Kansas market a few years ago.
<br><br>
While filling the kettle with water for oatmeal, he proceeded to grind fresh coffee beans in the grinder that was attached to the wall. During this time, he continued to drop just as many pans and pots as possible to arouse the family. When these clatters failed to awake anyone except Ethel, he recited in his unmistakable loud tenor voice, the little Irish poem;
 <ul style="list-style-type:none;" class="cursive">
<li>Jackie and Jennie </li>
<li>they lived in the rye,</li>
<li>They had a little baby </li>
<li>with one black eye.</li>
<li></li>
<li>"Jennie", said Jackie, </li>
<li>"let's knock it in the head."</li>
<li>"No Jackie," said Jennie, </li>
<li>"let's buy it some bread.</li>
<li></li>
<li>You buy it one loaf,</li>
<li>and I'll buy it two. </li>
<li>We'll bring up our children, </li>
<li>like other folks do."</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
Poems pleased the children. Hearing Papa sing or recite poetry early in the morning meant that he had not been lately too upset by some unpleasant incident, as a pole cat absconding under the back porch, or some similar happening.
<br><br>
When the usual chores such as lunch fixing were completed, the four older children loaded into the surrey. The son, Embrey, who was the oldest, was in the driver's seat, with his feet braced tight against the buckboard. Will gave him the usual admonition to "look after the girls" as Old Mark, the faithful old buggy horse scurried down the lane past the O'Bannons', Brother Tom Walton's, the Stuckeys' and Browns' on the way to school.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Ethel finished pounding the dasher in the wooden churn for fresh butter and remarked to Ina, the youngest daughter, that today they would take a broom and some old clothes out to the upper garden to make a scarecrow. This would frighten those pesky birds from the English peas, lettuce, and radishes. Tar Baby, Ina's black puppy, tagged along behind Ethel and Ina as they dressed up the old broom into a staunch and distinctive scarecrow.
<br><br>
Will hitched his mule team of Beck and Moodin to the nearest fencepost when he drove into view of the grotesque figure standing there, and armed with his horse-whip, decided to investigate. Imagine the jovial occasion his discovery afforded!

With the icy wind at our backs, we stepped on the tiny, brittle, lacy, Ice covered roadside pools to hear the tinkling sound. Later we attended East Ward and high school in town, riding in a buggy or surrey with hot bricks at our feet in winter.<br><br>
Much deference was given academic achievement and hard work; rarely did the latter preclude school attendance. The thrust of our purpose was adherence to spiritual values. Music was important.<br><br>
Some happiest times were singing around the piano. My father said every man should sing at his work, and truly my parents said their frustrations, exultations, joys, and faith in songs.<br><br><hr>
My first husband lost his life accidentally shortly after our son, Bobby, was born. We moved to Cranfills Gap in 1934. The road there from Hamilton, which we often made, was dusty and crooked. Once, Bobby, then four, getting out of the car to investigate a signal of trouble, and anticipating mechanical opportunities, clapped his hands and jubilantly cried,<br><br>"O Boy, look, Mommy, a flat!"
<br><br>
Clyde and I were married while he was in the grocery business and I was teaching.
Our two children were born at Cranfills Gap.<br><br>
Bobby was attending Texas Wesleyan College when we moved lo Fort Worth. After finishing, he worked as a tool designer, going later to Wisconsin. There he married Charlotte Munger; they have three children, Terri, Rex, and Mark. He is working for American Can.
<br><br>
Walton attended the Universities of Texas and Michigan. He lives in Austin with his wife, nee Pat Bird, his son, Matthew, and twin daughters, Kate and Kris.
<br><br>
Bette spends her extra time and cash traveling; she is getting another degree in Engineering.
<br><br>
Clyde, now eighty, still embellishes his fascinating stories of early life of Hamilton and Bosque counties
<br><br>
We still walk over grasslands where my grandfather J. M. Embrey, nearly a century ago had hundreds of sheep west of Hamilton.
<br><br>
The creek still runs part time that cooled my mother's feet and furnished mud to relieve her bee stings as she helped her father. Depressions remain where massive rocks were removed to build structures in town. Recently we found a fossil gastropod under a massive oak where my mother had played.
<br><br>
We still see the wild flowers coloring the pastures. The blue bells, winecups, Indian blankets, and paint brushes are still there.
We see the cedars clutching the hillsides, the oak clusters cleared goat-high, the willows with thirsty roots crowding the streams as we travel near Hamilton.
These pictures and memories I treasure.  Louise Bronstad

<blockquote class="Cb2"><img class="mlr"  src="../pic/Pinky/Walt-pinky.png" alt="picture Walt Bronstad">&nbsp;&nbsp;The housekeeper, Esther Schneider, is a surprise. My guess is that the onset of Ethel's diabetes limited her. Thus she needs help keeping the household running. Ethel, suffering untreated diabetes, may not have been up to bringing in wood each morning to get the wood-fired kitchen range going. Milking the cow, churning butter, bringing in water from the windmill tank - all required work, unfamiliar in contemorary kitchens.
<br><br> 
Seven years after this census date, Mother and I visited her parents; after wakeing and eating, she took me along to the barnyard, showing me the potatoe patch below the barnyard. Papa Walton found fertilizing the potatoes with cow manure a distasteful idea, but clearly potato plants closest to the barnyard flourished best. She showing me how to milk a cow, how to carefully keep barnyard trash from the cow's flank and udder, out of the pail whilst her exertions filled the pail with squirts of milk. Thence to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butter_churn" target="_blank">plunger-churn</a><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i> where more effort separated butterfat in gathering yellow balls from the milk. Later we went to the woodpile; while I was not instructed in use of the axe lest I remove a toe; I could carry in an armfull of split wood for the kitchen wood box.
<br><br>
Their niece Vivian Embrey is less surprising; she was making her way in the world and found temporary, familial assistance on her journey several times in the early '40's.

Now for the recollections: the first recollection, I would like to tell you about your grandmother, my great aunt Ethel. In 1960 I was a senior in college, doing my student teaching at Arlington Heights high school in Fort Worth, Texas. During the time I was doing my student teaching, I lived with Embrey and Beulah over on College Avenue in Fort Worth. Aunt Ethel came for a visit that lasted several weeks. (Emily was just a small baby). <br><br>Of course I had known Aunt Ethel for all my life, but I had never been around her for any extended period of time. At that time she must’ve been in her late 70s or early 80s But she was as much fun to be around as anyone my own age (21 at that time). We would go out to eat at colonial cafeteria and go shopping together and I hope that she had as much fun as I did. I can remember her telling me that when she was a child she rode a wagon pulled by horses, and that before she died, she hoped to ride on a spaceship to the moon. Her enthusiasm and love of life was infectious. --- Florence Ann Walton, Granddaughter of Florence (Embrey) Walton, a sister of Ethel (Embrey) Walton.

<p><i>First cousins share one pair of grandparents</i>; <u>double cousins share four grandparents</u>. Having the same four grandparents in common, defines the relationship "double cousin".</p>
<hr>
<p>
Double cousins are not a rarity, at least not in the earlier Walton Family. Janetha June (Walton) Donohue notes in her work from the Pearl Webb Cemetery, Canmer, KY: "T. D. Walton is Thomas Dandridge Walton and he was a brother of Wm. C. Walton. His wife, Susan, was a sister to Wilhemina Wood." There were 8 surviving children in the Wm. C. and Wilhemina (Wood) Walton family; There were 4 surviving children in the <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/about/L41P-DDW" target="_blank">Thomas Dandridge Walton</a><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i> and <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/about/L41P-DX9" target="_blank">Susan Virginia Wood</a><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i> family, making for a set of 12 double cousins which included Will and James. The relationship appears to recede into the past like a fractal pattern. Almost certainly the double cousin relationship is older than written history.
