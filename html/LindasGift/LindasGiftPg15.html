<p id="padcenter">Father wsa bending over her when she awoke. "You must get up now and help me plow this afternoon. George has to stay in fown until the car is ready. He telephoned just now. The men who are working on the car have to wait for some parts to come from the next town. It may be late before the parts come. Get up, Linda. We must hurry to get all the work done before dark. George can't plow this afternoon. You must help me."</p>
<p id="padcenter">By now she was beginning to understand.</p>
<p id="padcenter">"But, Father," she began. "Aunt Nell can stay only this afternoon."</p>
<p id="padcenter">"Get up, honey. Let's go." Tears came to her eyes. "Hurry" he said, helping her up.</p>
<p id="padcenter">"But can't Mamie go this afternoon?" she pleaded.</p>
<p id="padcenter">"Mother says Mamie must stay here to do wome sewing." Father was gentle.</p>
<p id="padcenter">But Linda knew she must delay no longer. One did not change Fathr's mind often. SHe had had no luck too many times. She moved slowly.</p>
<p id="padcenter">"Don't forget your jacket to protect you from the sun," Mother said as she gave her a cool drink of water.</p>
