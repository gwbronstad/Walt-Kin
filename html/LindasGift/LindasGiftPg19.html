<p id="padcenter"><mark>Suddenly there was a forward jerk and Linda found herself landing in the soft ground. Small black objects were bouncing off her body and face. The air was dark with flying soft balls. Beck, Peg and Mark were runing across the plowed part of the field dragging the plow after them.</mark></p>
<p id="padcenter"><mark>Father was yelling, "Bumble Bees! Watch out, Linda!".</mark></</p>
<p id="padcenter"><mark>Beck was kicking, Peg was jumping and whirling, and Mark was trying his best to shake them off. All the horses were switching their tails and jerking their heads frantically..</mark></</p>
<p id="padcenter"><mark>"The bees are stinging the horses. Are you stung Linda?" Father said..</mark></</p>
<p id="padcenter"><mark>"No, Father, I'm not hurt.".</mark></</p>
<p id="padcenter"><mark>He ran after Linda's horses yelling. "Whoa, Beck. Whoa, Peg! Whoa there!".</mark></</p>

<p id="padcenter"><mark>The air was clearig fast now..</mark></</p>
<p id="padcenter"><mark>"Where did the bees come from?" Linda asked..</mark></</p>
<p id="padcenter"><mark>"They had their nest in the ground. We plowed it up. They didn't like it. Were you stung, Linida?" he asked..</mark></</p>
<p id="padcenter"><mark>"Not at all." she answered..</mark></</p>
<p id="padcenter"><mark>"Well, I'm glad the horses did'nt tear up their harness. Wouldn't that jar your ancestors the way Mark got in a hurry?" Father laughed. It was a family joke that Mark was slow and lazy. But he was gentle, too..</mark></</p>
