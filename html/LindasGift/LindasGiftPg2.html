<p id="padcenter">She knew the plans made for her today. Last night Father had told her she must plow for a half day until her brother, George, should return from town. The car must be repaired and George should see that it  wasdone. The repair work would require only half a day. At noon, George would take the plow.</p>

<p id="padcenter">"It was hard work to plow she knew, as she had done it before. But today because of a wonderful secret and because someone special was conming, she did not mind the hard work.</p>
