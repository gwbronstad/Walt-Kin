<p id="padcenter">A little whirl of wind spun across the field. Bits of straw and dry leaves were carried high in the air, spinning around and around. The whirlwind seemed to bounce gently up and down as it sped across the field.</p>
<p id="padcenter">Just as she turned going north, there it was! A small car was going up toward the house. Few cars came up the road. Linda knew it was Aunt Nell.</p>
<p id="padcenter">In her mind Linda saw Mother and the others going out to meet her. They would be so happy to see her. She would be smiling and giving each a special hug and kiss.</p>
<p id="padcenter">Aunt Nell wore such lovely dresses. Wonder what her dress would be like today?</p>

<p id="padcenter">Then she would say, "Where's Linda?"</p>
<p id="padcenter">Many questions would be asked. Everyone would be gay. Mamie would go ahead with her sewing. There would be lemonade, cookies, and all kinds of fun. She would have a gift for each of them. A gift was not what Linda wanted, she wanted to be there and see her. One of the best  parts of her wonderful secret was spoiled.</p>
