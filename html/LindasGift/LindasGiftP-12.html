<p id="padcenter">After many rounds, Linda saw Father look up at the sun. It was his way of telling time. He got off the plow and looked at the shadow under his feet. She knew he would say it was time for lunch. </p>
<p id="padcenter">How glad she was to be through with her work. She would stay home and get ready for Aunt Nell.</p>
<p id="padcenter">Quickly she unhitched her horses and drove them across the field. It was so good to be going home. She was tired but that did not matter. No need to shake the loose dirt from her shoes until she got out of the field. They would fill up again quickly.</p>
<p id="padcenter">She followed Father down the road that led from the hill to the barn. The horses splashed through the small stream, but she jumped lightly.</p>

<p id="padcenter">The horses drank a long time at the water tank near the barn. Then Linda fed them corn and oats.</p>
