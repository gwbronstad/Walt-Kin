<p id="padcenter">Holding back her tears, Linda went toward the barn.</p>
<p id="padcenter">Soon she found herself driving the horses back toward the field. Instead of jumping the little stream as she had this morning, she did not get across with dry feet. Mud covered one shoe. Twice she almost stumbled over the ends of the reins which were dragging on the ground. Father spent more time helping her hitch the horses in the plow that he had this morning. He hooked the inside chains so she would not have to bend her head so close to Peg's heels. He seemed to remember that Linda had always dreaded getting near to Peg's heels.</p>
