<p id="padcenter">As horses neared a bush quails rushed near them. They whirred noisily awaky while Mark showed his annoyance with a snort. </p>
<p id="padcenter">After reaching the field, the horses were quickly hitched to the plow. </p>
<p id="padcenter">Father said, "I'm glad you're helping me plow today, Linda.  Two plows can break this field much faster than one." </p>
<p id="padcenter">When the wheat or oat field was plowed after the grain had been cut, he called it breaking the field. </p>
<p id="padcenter">As Father's plow went first around the field, it took off three slices of the stubbled earth and turned them on their sides. Linda's plow came next and took off two slices, laying them over evenly. She must be careful to keep Peg in the furrow cut by Father's plow to make her s cut properly. </p>
