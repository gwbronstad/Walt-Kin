<p id="padcenter">As she went slowly up the path  that led to the house a turkey rushed toward her. with his wings spread until they scraped the ground, he said, "Gobble!! Gobble!"</p>
<p id="padcenter">He was used to her jumping forward to frighten him. Today she said, "Go away, Mr. Gobbler"</p>

<p id="padcenter">At the windmill LInda drank for a long time. How cold and good the water was!</p>

<p id="padcenter">Kitty, jumpig from the cot, came up to her curving his back for a nice long rub against her leg. But something made him change his mind. He walked away from her.</p>

<p id="padcenter">Ring, the big black and white dog, ran up to Linda lifting his head for her pat. Wagging his tail, he waited while she drank. She reached out  put her hand on his head, but did'nt look at him. Suddenly he dashed off to chase Kitty up a tree.</p>

<p id="padcenter">Voices could be heard coming from the kitchen, Linda decided to rest on the cot for a few minutes before going into the house.</p>
