<p id="padcenter">Darkness was coming fast now. A light was turned on in the house. Linda was almost asleep when she heard someone near her.</p>
<p id="padcenter">"Why Linda, Dear! Why didn't you come in?  We didn't  know you were here."</p>
<p id="padcenter">Was she dreaming? It was Aunt Nell!</p>
<p id="padcenter">"Aunt Nell!" Linda's arms went around her neck. "I thought you went home!"</p>
<p id="padcenter">"Well, surely you would have come in to see me if you had known I was here!" Aunt Nell teased. </p>
<p id="padcenter">But wasn't it your car I saw leave?" Linda asked.</p>
<p id="padcenter">I had to send my car to town, too. That changed my plans. I can stay until tomorrow afternoon."</p>
<p id="padcenter">"Oh Aunt Nell! Wait!" Linda seemed to have a new surge of eagarness. "Wait here just a minute."
