<p id="padcenter">Linda's mind went to the lovely box Aunt Nell had given her. It was a small wooden box with a tree design carved on the lid. In it she kept her most precious treasures, which were a robin's egg, a small brass bell, a few pictures, and a dried leaf with only the veins left. She called this her lace leaf. But since yesterday there was a most wonderful treasure in the box.</p>

<div>
<p id="padcenter">She had almost told her secret to Mamie, her sister, late yesterday afternoon after she had made the discovery. But then Mother had said Aunt Nell was coming, so she decided to wait.</p>
<p id="padcenter">Susy, her close friend who lived on the next farm, did not even know yet. Linda had not yet left a note in their secret mail box. In an old cigar box hidden under a flat rock near the corner post of the fence they often echanged messages. They called it thier secret mail box and enjoyed its mystery and secrecy.</p>
