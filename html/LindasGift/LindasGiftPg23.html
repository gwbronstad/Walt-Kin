<p id="padcenter">Small dark clouds covered the sun once in a while. They made a welcome shadow. Soon a larger dark cloud covered the sun. Rain drops came, large and far apart.</p>
<p id="padcenter">Father called back, "It's just a light shower. It will soon be over. Let's go ahead with our work."</p>

<p id="padcenter">Father was right. It was over in a few minutes. Linda knew her jacket would dry quickly in the sunshine that would return.</p>

<p id="padcenter">The rounds were quite short now and the sun's rays were much kider. At last when the sun was low in the sky, Father stopped his horses.</p>

<p id="padcenter">"Well, we did not get through, but it won't take me long in the morning to finish this. Let's go home, Linda."</p>

<p id="padcenter">When they reached the barn Father sent Linda to the house. You're tired, honey. I'll feed your horses."</p>
