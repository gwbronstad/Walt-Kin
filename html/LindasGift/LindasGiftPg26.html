<p id="padcenter">"Look in it!" she said softly.</p>
<p id="padcenter">"A bird's nest" Aunt Nell said. Then she gasped. For woven in and out of the nest was a string with a few blue beads on it. On one side ot the nest hung one bead more beautiful than the rest It was the much loved center bead.</p>
<p id="padcenter">Linda didn't wait to be asked "I found it in the hackberry tree, and on the ground I found&mdash;Look&mdash;many of the other beads that were lost from the string. See, they're in the box!"</p>
<p id="padcenter">Aunt Nell said no more. She just took Linda into her arms.</p>
<p id="padcenter">"Now wouldn't that jar your ancestors?" Father said.</p>
