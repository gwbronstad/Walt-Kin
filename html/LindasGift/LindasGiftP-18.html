<p id="padcenter">The plowing went on much as before. Each round found Linda more tired than ever. They stopped for water but it was hot. The sand in her shoes hurt her toes. It had been a long time since she had shaken the dirt out. Each time the moved the lever of the plow, she had to stand.</p>
 
<p id="padcenter">Once she saw a lone bumblebee sitting on the handle of the lever. "If you had stung me, Mr. BumblebeeI could have gone to the house after something to put on it maybe," she said as she flipped him away with her finger. </p>

 <p id="padcenter">She looked down the hill at the little gray pond where she loved to fish. This mothing it had looked like a little grey kitten curled up the the feet of the willow trees beyond it. Yesterday during a strong wind she had seen the willlows tugging at their roots as though they wanted to free themselves from the ground. Today they were gently yielding to the slight wind.</p>

<p id="padcenter">Today as she looked at the flat gray water she thought, "You have a dirty look on your face."</p>

<p id="padcenter">Once she saw a car on the road going to the highway. It must be Aunt Nell leaving. Tears kept her from seeing for sure. It was about time for her to leave. At least a year would pass before she would come again because she lived so for away.</p>
