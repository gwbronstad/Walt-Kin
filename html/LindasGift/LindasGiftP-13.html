<p id="padcenter">"George has not come yet from town," Mother told Father as they came into the house.</p>
<p id="padcenter">"It is taking longer to fix the car than we thought," Father replied.</p>
<p id="padcenter">A little fear caught at Llnda's mind. What if George didn't get back in time to finish the plowing?" But surely Father would ask Mamie to plow if George didn't come.</p>

<p id="padcenter">Mother had always told Linda to rest after lunch if she had been working in the field. So she lay across the bed.</p>
<p id="padcenter">As she lay there she thought of the things she would do in just a few minutes. She would take a bath, wash her hair, and let it dry quickly in the sun.</p>

<p id="padcenter">Then she would put on one of her best dresses and slip a pretty blue ribbon in her hair. After helping Mother wash dishes, she would make some lemonade.</p>

<p id="padcenter">All these plans were running through her mind when sleep overtook her.</p>
