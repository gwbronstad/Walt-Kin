<h2 style="font-size: 1.0em;">The story, <u>Linda's Gift</u> came from the egg of Mother's fertile imagination, nested securely in her life history.</h2>
<p style="font-size: 1.0em;">To understand it, I made some immediate connections, interpreting it as autobiographical of Louise.</p>

<div class="newspaper">

<p id="padcenter">Louise often told me she was given mens' work. After little brother Frederick died, there was but one son in the family, Uncle Embrey.</p><br>
<p id="padcenter">Linda is Louise; of the four girls in Will and Ethel Walton's family, she fell most into the pattern of her mother, doing outdoor work; there were not enough sons in their families. Thus Mame (Annie Joy) sews while Linda/Louise plows the field in the absence of brother George (Embrey).</p><br>

<p id="padcenter">Seven year old Louise looks too young the handle the lever lifting the plow shear out of the earth on each turning around of the team of horses. </p><br>

<p id="padcenter">This Embrey is a little too old for the story. This picture was taken on his wedding day. To me, he's the model for George</p><br>

<p id="padcenter">This Louise is removed from the farm by two years of education and two ore more years of teaching. Really too old to be this story's Linda.</p><br>

</div>
<p id="padcenter">The model for Aunt Nell could have been Aunt Nelly Wren Golightly, wife of Louise's Uncle Ambrose Embrey. She does not fit the story well, living too close to have been a rare visitor and not likely to have been sufficiently affluent to shower the children with gifts. The real Aunt Nell was neither a Walton nor an Embrey, nor an Aunt of the character Linda. She was Bobby's great aunt, aunt of Marshall Holbrook. Much beloved by Mother in part because of all the Holbrooks, she most maintained the connection to Bob and Louise. Aunt Nell's centrality to the story is an expression of Mothers love for the real Aunt Nell, aunt of Louise's late husband, Marshall Holbrook.</p><br>

<p id="padcenter">I'm pretty sure they would appreciate the humor.</p>
