				<H4 CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><a name="A">Jess and Kris: New Moms in an Old-School Society</a></H4>	
					<P>Note: 
Jess and Kris B. are out among friends, family, and staff at the University of Tennessee, where both work. But out of concern for their eight-month-old daughter and their professional and home privacy, they requested that only their first names be used for this article.</P>
					<P>Jess B. was reviewing a website a student had helped her create this summer. Just coincidentally, he’d designed the buttons on the home page in rainbow colors. She remarked on the choice, “It looks a little gay.” He said, “I didn’t notice. Do you want me to change it?”</P>
					<P>Jess’ eyes are full of humor when she recalls her reply: “I told him, ‘No, that’s okay. I’m gay.’ He was like, ‘No. You’re gay?’ And I said, ‘Yes I am.’ He was shocked, even though he’d worked with me all the previous spring. He kept saying, ‘I don’t care, I just had no idea. You just had a baby!’ and I said ‘Um hum.’ And he was like, ‘What about that guy you talk to on the phone all the time, your husband?’

<P>“‘You mean my wife, Kris?’”</P>
					<P>Jess, who’s 35, and Kris, who’s 33, have encountered similar reactions since moving to Knoxville in summer ’09, and they say that’s what makes them ill at ease as lesbian Knoxvillians: Most people here still have no concept that there might be same-sex couples among them, even the ones who would be kindly if they knew.</P>
					<P>“It’s like it doesn’t even occur to people here that this sort of family exists outside of San Francisco, New York, and Hollywood movies,” says Kris. “There’s this disconnect with things that are happening in wider America.”</P>
					<P>And so few of their LGBT peers are out, says Jess. “I know it can’t be true that we’re the only lesbian couple with a baby in all of Knoxville, but it’s how it feels. Some individuals at the university have been very supportive of Kris and I, but I do feel like the university, like the rest of Knoxville, has a cloud of closetedness over it. It makes us feel a little alienated here, like we are the only ones who are comfortable with our sexuality, in our skin, and out in the world. I don’t want our daughter having to grow up in that climate. I want it to be different.”</P>
					<P>Both contend they have never experienced any homophobia in Knoxville directly. “No one’s ever yelled, ‘Dykes!’ on the street or anything,” says Jess.</P>
					<P>“There may be a few remarks that get lobbed in our direction, but if so, they’re so Southern we aren’t getting it,” adds Kris.</P>
					<P>Neither of the women feel unsafe, in part because they’re not the type—they commonly drive into Mexico, for example. They also say being lesbian in the area doesn’t seem threatening in a physical sense. “I tell people I’m gay or they find out and they’ll usually say, ‘Oh, Knoxville, no one’s going to bother you, but I wouldn’t go out to any of those little nearby towns,’” says Kris</P>
					<P>Much more troubling to the pair is what they consider the blatant intolerance behind the refusal of the University of Tennessee to offer benefits to same-sex domestic partners, or extend them family leave. “People in our respective departments and upper administration have been supportive when we voice complaints, and I do understand that their hands have been tied by the state Legislature on the matter, but it’s quite frustrating,” says Jess. Such state policies don’t make up the fabric of Jess and Kris’s everyday lives, though, and they say confrontations aren’t the norm. For her part, Kris says, she may assist in avoiding controversy, simply because she edits her remarks. She’s out, but unless she knows someone pretty well and they seem open, she rarely mentions her home life. “I try not to offend people when I don’t have to,” she says. “I don’t want them to have to pause in their day because they feel offended.”</P>
					<P>Jess has no such compunction: “I don’t give a shit if who I love offends people,” she says.</P>
					<P>Kris did have one mild altercation, but says she’s the one who ended up feeling a little bad about it. A group on campus was handing out bags of candy. “I was in a particularly bad mood, or I would have just walked on, but one girl said ‘Come join my church!’ I said, ‘Let me ask you a question. I have a wife and kid, do you respect us as a family?’ or something garbled like that. She was confused and finally said, ‘I don’t see that as being a family.’”</P>
					<P>Neither Jess nor Kris had the turmoil East Tennesseans associate with coming out—not with friends or family. Kris knew she was a lesbian when she was 14 and living in Austin, Texas. A forward-thinking group called Out Youth was based in Austin, and Kris worked their national hotline and was a liason for the high school gay-student alliance, sometimes speaking before the school board. When she came out to her mom, she remembers only her laughing and saying, “I’m not surprised.”</P>
					<P>Jess, who grew up in Toronto, says she didn’t feel gay at that same age, which is why she didn’t come out until grad school around 11 years ago, the same time she got together with her first girlfriend. “It was all one process, introducing my girlfriend and coming out, and that made it easier. My father did say, ‘But I’d always hoped you’d marry, and have a child.’ And here we are.”</P>
					<P>Kris and Jess had been together for four years when Kris asked Jess to marry her one night while they were doing dishes. “How romantic is that?” Kris jokes.</P>
					<P>They got married in Canada, where same-sex marriage has been legal since July 2005, and a 2007 law extends a child’s parentage to three individuals, the biological mother and father along with the mother’s lesbian partner. Kris recalls the matter-of-factness of it all. “Jess’ mom was telling people from their street, neighbors, ‘My daughter got married! This is her wife!’ These are just ordinary urban Toronto people, complete strangers, and they were just happy. No shock, nothing to recover from. They might have privately felt, ‘That’s not right’ and maybe it wouldn’t be the same everywhere in Canada, but to us, they were saying ‘Congratulations.’ No shame anywhere.”</P>
					<P>The two are a comfortable couple, easy together, not sitting close but constantly consulting with glances and quick remarks—about the baby’s monitor, and their outsized dog’s chewy, and where the guest should sit to avoid remnants from the baby’s supper underfoot. They live in a cozy house close to downtown, in a neighborhood popular with UT staff, and seem much like any other liberal couple on a weeknight, eating salad from a glazed artisan’s bowl and quoting NPR.</P>
					<P>They came to Knoxville for Jess’ job as an assistant professor at UT. “We moved here because the people in my department were wonderful,” says Jess. “It also helped that we have a friend from here, Liz Albertson, who raves about the place.” Jess had already accepted the position when Jim David Adkisson entered the sanctuary where children were performing Annie, Jr. at the Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist church and opened fire, killing two and later revealing an anti-gay bias as part of his motivation.</P>
					<P>With her characteristic vigor and sailor’s vocabulary, Jess remembers almost rescinding her acceptance: “I’m thinking, ‘I can’t f--king believe I’m moving to that town.’”</P>
					<P>Kris, too, felt, still feels, the horror. “That’s a terrifying thing, someone opening fire on a church. I can’t even contemplate the philosophy behind why the guy did it. And that was the town I was coming to, to raise a child.”</P>
					<P>The friendship with Albertson trumped the fear, and a school year later the women came to Knoxville, and entered a world where their lifestyle was no longer openly acknowledged, much less common place, which is what they’d been used to. “In Madison, you couldn’t throw a stone without hitting a lesbian mom,” says Jess. “My friend from Austin was in a prenatal class and there were five, count them, five other lesbian couples. Where we had our baby in Knoxville, even though they were very good and it was completely comfortable, I felt like I was the first ever lesbian there.”</P>
					<P>In their previous cities, the queer population was large, diverse, and visible. “Until Knoxville, we’ve never lived in a place where a community seemed so inaccessible to us,” says Jess. “We’d like to know more of our peers.”</P>
					<P>Adds Kris: “Our primary reason to want to meet other gay couples is so our child isn’t raised thinking she’s growing up in a creepy family.”</P>
					<P>The two giggle over being introduced to people they’re immediately supposed to hit it off with because they’re all gay. “And we know these really cool people who probably would never hang out with us in another city, but they feel they have to here,” says Kris.</P>
					<P>Even at the university, where colleagues are very concerned about supporting diversity in the student body, very few of the LGBT faculty want to be out themselves, notes Jess. “Some are, but many are not.”</P>
					<P>She and Jess would feel comfortable holding hands in public, but they don’t usually, because Kris isn’t into PDA. Still, she says she wishes the option was more open, to her, and to other same-sex couples in the community.</P>
					<P>“It’s not about whether you actuallly do it; it’s about having the freedom,” she says, “Other people, straight people, don’t realize the many things they don’t even have to think about. What I’d like is for all of us not to have to worry about someone taking offense.”</P>
					<P>Jess admits she can be harsh; she’s impatient with closeted Knoxvillians. “Because so many people aren’t just out, it makes them hard to meet; it makes my life more difficult.”</P>
					<P>Yes, she admits with a sigh, that’s easy for her to say. “I didn’t have to worry when I came out; I knew my family would still love me.”</P>
					<P>Kris especially understands that the fear of being out in Knoxville has a real basis for some, and she realizes that she and Jess are privileged in this situation, both because of the solid acceptance from everyone they care about, and because their livelihoods or personal safety are never threatened by their sexual orientation. “I may be naive, but I feel like a lot of fear just creates more fear, until now we’ve got this environment where no one ever tests the water, because the perceived risk is so humongous. That needs to change. Or maybe the risk is so humongous. Maybe Jess and I will find that out. ”</P>
					<P>They know they are not in Madison, or Austin, or Canada anymore. But just once Kris and Jess would like to dine out in Knoxville without being asked if they’d like to split the bill onto separate checks. “We’ll be talking, sitting at the table. It’s not like we’re having a marital fight, or making out. But we are equally taking care of the baby; she’s there, too,” says Jess.</P>
					<P>It makes her sputter that even the “liberal” restaurants like some of those on Market Square don’t consider the possibility that they’re a couple on a date. “It’s very clear to me that we’re a family out for dinner, but no one seems to get it.”</P>
					<P>Much more encouraging to her is an e-mail she received from a colleague a few weeks back, subject line, “long overdue.”</P>
					<P>“I came out to my class, and the world’s still turning,” the text read. “Thanks for the nudge.”</P>

		<H4 CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><a name="C">Obituary of Gracie (Sorenson) Knudson</a></H4>
			<p>Gracie Sorenson Knudson [<A href="Photos/GO/HH/GracieKnudson.jpg">Photo</a>], age 97 passed away on July 14, 2012 in 
Hamilton, TX. Burial was in St. Olaf's 
Lutheran Cemetery (Rock Church), Cranfills, Gap, TX.</p>
			<p>Gracie was born January 1, 1915 near Clifton, Texas.  She was the 
fourth of five children born to Canute & Gunella Dahl Sorenson.  She 
was baptized at Trinity Lutheran Church in Clifton.  All four of 
Gracie's mother's grandparents emigrated from Norway in the 1850's, 
and were among the pioneer settlers in Bosque County.  On her 
father's side, his mother emigrated from Norway and his father from 
Denmark. Their lives were centered around the Scandinavian Lutheran Church.</p>
			<p>The family moved to Clifton, and then to a farm near Fairy. The next 
move was to the Parks Ranch near where Gracie began her education at 
Meridian Creek School, and where the family joined Our Saviour's 
Lutheran Church at Norse. The school was small, but excellent and 
gave Gracie and the other students an opportunity to participate in 
Interscholastic League events. She excelled in spelling, 
declamation, and art memory as well as sports.</p>
			<p>In 1928 they bought a farm near Cranfills Gap.  They joined St. 
Olaf's Lutheran Church where she met her future husband, Oran 
Knudson. Oran's great grandparents had emigrated from Norway, and 
were also early settlers of Bosque County.  After graduating from 
Clifton Lutheran College, Oran returned to Cranfills Gap where he 
taught school and was principal.  He even taught Gracie in her 
senior year.  She always enjoyed learning, and also loved playing 
tennis, basketball, and softball.  She continued do her share of 
work on the farm.  She graduated from Cranfills Gap High School as 
valedictorian of the class of 1933.</p>
			<p>Gracie continued her education at Clifton Lutheran Junior College 
where she was valedictorian of the Class of 1935.  Oran was 
continuing his education at the University of Texas in Austin when 
he competed for the job of clerk at the Hamilton Post Office in 
1936.  It was during the Great Depression and sixty people applied 
for the job.  Oran scored highest on the test. A few months later, 
Oran and Gracie were married on Oct. 4 at St. Olaf Lutheran 
Church.  Oran was promoted to Assistant Post Master in a few years 
and worked there for 33 years.  He died on May 29, 1969.</p>
			<p>Oran and Gracie were blessed with five children:  Myron Oran and 
wife Doris of Dallas, Kathryn Sue and husband Bill Klingman of Katy, 
John Benjamin and Pam of Comanche, Linda Beth and husband Don Ray of 
Austin. The youngest child Thomas Charles passed away in December 
2010.  His wife Pam now lives in San Antonio.  Oran & Gracie managed 
to send all five of the children to the University of Texas at 
Austin.  Gracie had nine grandchildren, five step-grandchildren, 
eight great grandchildren, and eleven step-great 
grandchildren.  Family was always a priority and Gracie loved 
cooking for large crowds of relatives.</p>
			<p>When the children were at home Gracie was very active in the P.T.A., 
was president and held other offices.  She was a longtime leader of 
Blue Birds, Campfire Girls, and Cub Scouts. She was involved in the 
Hamilton Garden Club and the Ladies' Auxiliary of the National 
Association of Postal Supervisors.</p>
			<p>In the 1950's after all the children were in school, she continued 
her education by taking extension courses and summer courses.  She 
began teaching in a two-room school at Aleman where she taught the 
lower grades for five years until the school consolidated with 
Hamilton.  She received her B.S. Degree from Howard Payne College in 
1968.  She finished her teaching career in Hamilton ISD where she 
taught for thirteen years.  Gracie retired after eighteen years of 
teaching in 1980, but continued to be a tireless worker in her many 
church and civic activities.</p>
			<p>At St. John Lutheran Church Gracie taught Sunday School and Vacation 
Bible School for many years, taught the "Crossways" adult Bible 
Class, and was President of the Board of Christian Education. She 
wrote, with the help of others, the history of the congregation for 
the 25th and 50th anniversaries. She was president and held other 
offices of the Lutheran Women's Missionary League (Ruth Guild).  She 
served as president of the Zone for the Texas Lutheran Women's 
Missionary League.  She was a representative to the Aid Association 
for Lutherans for many years. She worked as a volunteer for United 
Care, and made many quilts for World Relief.
She served as president of the Texas Retired Teacher's Association, 
the Hamilton County Education Extension Association (Pottsville 
Club), and Delta Kappa Gamma (a Teachers' Sorority).  She also gave 
her time to the Hamilton General Hospital Auxiliary, The Norwegian 
Society of Texas, Silver-Haired Texans, and the Hamilton Genealogical Society,
She wrote and compiled a history of her grandparents Martin and 
Astrid (Lien) Sorenson and their descendants with genealogy and 
photos.  In addition, she contributed for many years to the updating 
of the genealogies for several other branches of the family.  For 
this she corresponded with many members of the extended family to 
collect dates for current births, deaths, marriages and divorces 
when updated genealogies were to be printed.
She loved gardening and working in the yard.  She always had lots of 
flowers, an extensive vegetable garden, many types of fruit trees, 
and many pecan trees. Every year much time was spent in canning and 
preserving, as well as picking up and shelling pecans.
Some of Gracie's children lived and worked in other countries, and 
she enjoyed visiting them in Saudi Arabia, Spain, Germany, England 
and Japan.  She also traveled to many states in the U.S.  She always 
wrote a detailed account of her trips for the Hamilton Herald-News.
Gracie lived an extraordinary life as a Christian and served God by 
serving others in any capacity where she was needed.  She was an 
amazing role model for her family and for many others.  We are all 
left with memories of her devotion to family, church and community.</p>
			<p>The family wishes to thank Dixie and Gary Gromatzky for their 
friendship and exceptional devotion to Gracie during the past several years.</p>
			<p>Memorials may be given to St. John Lutheran Church, 122 Cheyenne 
Mesa, Hamilton, TX 76531, or St Olaf's Lutheran Church (Rock 
Church), 402 Meridian St., Cranfills Gap, TX 76637, or a favorite charity.</p>

			<P><A href="./SGeng/GO-D.html#&laquo;0.D-2.A&raquo;">Winnon Glenson (Bob) Holbrook</a>
died peacefully in Brillion, Wisconsin, on November 21, at the age of 80 following a 2-year battle with cancer. He was born May 8, 1932, to Marshall and Louise (Walton) Holbrook in Waskom, Texas. After Marshall's accidental death in 1933, Louise married Clyde Bronstad who became Bob's stepfather. He received his diploma from Cranfills Gap High School in 1949, and in 1953, graduated from Texas Wesleyan College in Ft. Worth Texas. He served in the Texas National Guard from 1949 to 1958. He later moved to Appleton, WI, where he married Charlotte (Stiebs) Munger on December 9, 1961 and became an instant father to her 2 young children.</p>
<p>Bob worked as a machine designer and tool designer for such companies as American Can Company, Kimberly-Clark, and General Dynamics.

			<P>Marc Denzel Johnson of Cranfills Gap, went home to be with the Lord on March 23, 2013. The memorial service for Marc will be Wednesday, March 27, at 2 p.m. at St. Olaf Lutheran Church in Cranfills Gap where he was an active member. He lived in faith and died in grace. </p>
			<p>Marc was born Nov. 7, 1938, to Elvis and Ina Johnson, baptized as a baby on Dec. 11, 1938, and confirmed on May 24, 1953, at St. Olaf Lutheran Church. On May 23, 1957, he married Betty A. Knudson, and then served in the U. S. Navy until 1961 as a jet engine mechanic.</p>
			<p>Marc returned to Cranfills Gap, and in 1969, he helped start Gap Tractor Salvage. He was locally known as the "Fat Man" from the Gap, and all over the United States he was well-known as the expert in "experienced" tractor parts. He had a passion for antique tractors, emceeing at tractor pulls and auctioneering at various benefits in the area. He was always a passionate volunteer for a good cause, even working with UPS for 16 years to get them the right to carry packages intra-state.</p>
			<p>Marc became very popular for writing a column "Marc's Remarks," which ran in local newspapers for many years. He served as mayor of Cranfills Gap from 1990 to 1999, striving to further the development of the water department among other projects critical to the town. Marc never met a stranger--he became friends with everyone he met and worked with. Now those friends are too numerous to count.</p>
			<p>Preceding Marc in death are his parents; two sons, Marcus Wayne Johnson and Jeffrey Don Johnson; and his sister, Carla Sue Johnson.</p>
			<p>He is survived by his wife, Betty, of 56 years, son Tommy Wayne Johnson, and grandson Kevin Wayne Johnson all of Cranfills Gap; and a sister Marilyn Barnes of Robinson. There are many cousins, nieces, nephews and great-nieces and nephews. In lieu of flowers, donations may be sent to St. Olaf Lutheran Church, 402 Meridian Street in Cranfills Gap, TX 76637 or your favorite charity. Clifton Funeral Home was in charge of arrangements.</p>

		<H4 CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER>Funeral oration by Misty Chappell.</H4>	
			<P>In the book of John it reads: "in heaven my fathers house there are many mansions. I go to prepare a place for you. and if I prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself, so that where I am you will be also and where ever I go you will know the way...." Looks like granny was ready for papa to join her in heaven's mansions...</p>
	<p>Well, I suppose its time for us to stop being selfish and for papa [Franklin Delano Bird] to to stop being stubborn and go home to his bride Meano [Rita Aline Bird].  Granny finally got her way and called him home to heaven's mansions, because she clearly missed him like we all will forever, but she also needed her garage sale driver back at the wheel. Now that they're together once again it wouldn't surpise one bit if papa's already found a scrap yard or a Home Depot because we can guarantee he'll be building his own house, like before.</p>
	<p> I don't see papa as the mansion type. I can almost bet by now he's got the walls and foundation done for him and granny's new home. That's just how he was. a busy busy man of many talents.</p>
	<p> Like I said when granny passed, growing up we always as kids thought we had drawn the short end of the stick: always wanting to to live in a normal subdivision with nice homes but little did we know we had it made. I can almost guarantee most of my cousins and myself spent some time helping to lay shingles, or pour concrete. He was always up to somethin', usually about 10 things at a time driving granny nuts. Starting one project then another and another before a year later going back to finish the original project. But due to his construction capabilities, and all the things he taught us and due to his semi hoarding it always gave us grandkids something to do. There would always be just enough wood, nails, paint and junk laying around [so] we could make our own awesome forts. Windows and shingles and all. </p>
	<p> Papa was one of the hardest working men I've ever known. He'd be out from sun up till sun down just fidgeting with whatever he could. Shirtless usually, so as a kid it always cracked my up when he'd get out of the shower and look like an Indian from the waist up but white as an Eskimo down his leg. Another thing that makes me laugh is his always telling me to bring him his orange handled pliers or whichever tool. I'd look forever and be like papa, you don't have any orange handle pliers. </p>
	<p> He'd get frustrated come to the tool box and grab them immediately (they'd be green or something random) because he was color blind. And also I want to apologized for all the time I mocked him while sweeping. He'd be sweeping and ask me to find a crash bag, I'd say "papa, you want a trash bag or a crash bag, because we all know he would never wear his teeth. So me being a smart alec would  and come back say I couldn't find a crash bag & which always resulted in him chasing me down the hall with the broom. </p>
	<p> Papa was the funniest man I've ever known. If you stood next to him you better bet hes gonna' start a conversation with you. Whether it be about Obama being the antechrist, UFOs, the Bible, Hitler and the Iraqies being aliens. It was never a dull moment with papa. I remember one time I had to go to the courthouse with him downtown and of course he set off the metal detectors. They asked him to empty his pockets. He pulled out handful after handful of, washers, nuts, bolts, drill bits and probably about 10$ in spare change. All I could do was laugh. </p>
	<p> Oh and the shortcuts lol. Papa always took the scenic route which I admire now. Life's too short to be in a rush. His shortcuts usually added 20 min to an hour to your destination but it was always about the scenery not the time. We should all take more shortcuts lol. </p>
	<p> Oh and there was the invention of birball lol. What I wouldn't give fot one more healthy game of papa kicking it across the road like soccer or Rick splitting his pants lol. Good times. </p>
	<p> And I also want to say thank you again papa for acting like superman and waking me up by throwing me over you shoulders and running me way out into the pasture to ensure I was safe when the house caught on fire and we were all sleeping. I love you. You truly were and always will be one of my real life superheros  I read somewhere that if you make your children or in your case even grandchildren happy, you will continue to make them happy 20 years later by the memory of it. </p>
	<p> We love you papa thank you for everything you've always done for us for all your great memories. Give granny hugs and kisses and tell her thank you for the cardinals continually watching over us. I'll keep trying to win that lotto for you, but until it's our time to join you two in heaven in your homemade mansion, for now I'll just see ya in the funny papers.</p>

			<P>Beulah Woody Walton departed this life on July 23, 2019.  Beulah was born the seventh of ten children of Wyatt William and Loucreta Wise Woody in Kalmia, North Carolina on April 26, 1925.  She grew up during the Great Depression around Hawk, a Cane Creek community, in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Western NC.  Beulah graduated from Bowman High School in Bakersville, NC in 1942.  Soon after graduating high school, she went to work for an ordnance company in Kingsport, TN supporting the war effort until the end of World War II.     </p>

	<P>After the end of the war, Beulah worked several jobs that would keep her near her home and her parents.  In 1949, she decided to attend King’s Business College in Charlotte, NC.  She was hired by the Department of the Navy in 1951 and moved by herself to Washington DC.  In the late 1950s, Beulah met her future husband, William Embrey Walton.  They were married in October of 1959 and she moved to Fort Worth, TX.    They had two children Emily and Paul.  The family attended Travis Ave Baptist Church where her husband was a long time member.  </p>
	<P>Beulah continued working for the Federal Government in Fort Worth and eventually started working at General Services Administration.  She retired from her position with GSA in 1987.  She started working for Colonial Cafeterias as a server in 1977 and continued into the 1990s, when she fully retired.  
Beulah was a caring and loving mother who did everything she could to promote her children.  Her hard work helped to put Emily and Paul through college.  When her first grandchild Lauren arrived, Beulah proved to be an even more caring and loving grandmother.  Her four grandchildren were the world to her.  In her later years she had two four legged companions that provided her with a lot of company.  Beulah remained living in her own home until 2017.  She spent her final years at the Mirabella Assisted Living Facility in Fort Worth.  </p>
	<P>Beulah is survived by her daughter, Emily and her husband, Brad Minnich; her son, Paul and his wife Susan Walton; her grandchildren: Dr. Lauren and her husband Dr. Matthew Evans; Rachel and her husband Trent McGee; Wyatt Walton; Laramie Walton; her great grandchildren: Alewen Evans; Ellery Evans; Elizabeth Mc Gee; her brother Fred Woody; and her sister Betty Buchanan.    Donations can be made in lieu of flowers to the Alzheimer’s Association or the Humane Society of North Texas.  She will be buried at St. Olaf Kirke Cemetery, near Cranfills Gap, TX.</p>
