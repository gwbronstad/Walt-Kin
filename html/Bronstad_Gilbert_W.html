      <h3> The Clifton Record (a Bosque County, Texas weekly newspaper) recorded the comings and goings in quiet neighboring areas like Cranfills Gap; all the better to increase readership beyond Clifton, TX. I mined microfilm of the Clifton Record for family references. I saw slimmest images of my coming into the social awareness of the Gap, much as one might see, passing a wooden fence, a kinetoscopic view of a neighbors back yard. Slim little images my past like:  </h3>
<h4>1940-10-11</h4>
<p>On Tuesday morning, September 24, a son was born to <b>Mr. and Mrs. Clyde Bronstad</b>. He has been named Gilbert Walton and is a fine, healthy child, He and his mother are reported to be doing nicely.</p>
<blockquote class="gwb">As best as I can remember, I was born in my parent's bed, delivered by family friend, Dr. J. R. Shipp. </blockquote>
</div>
<div class="grid-item">
<p>In a community like Cranfills Gap, very little went unnoticed. There were no Gestapo or NKVD spies earning their State Secutity keep, but there were neighbors who wanted to know which kin visited whom and where their neighbors had been the last two days.</p><br>
<p> Such information did not so much stabilize the state as sell the local weeklies, The <u>Clifton Record</u> or the <u>Meridian Tribune</u>. To me, <u>The Clifton Record</u> offered richer ore. There seemed to have been more Norwegian ties between Cranfills gap (the Gap) and Clifton than beween the Gap and Meridian.</p><hr>
<p>Experientially, as a child in Cranfills Gap, I found this community's neighbor nosiness oppressive. By way of example, like most boys I was very interested in guns. Natural enough; Cranfils Gap was distinctly rural; unlike Clyde's family, most families owned one or more firearms. High on the list of entertainment were western cowboy adventure movies and adventure themed radio; firearms often played a central r&ocirc;le. (Television had not penetrated to our area of Texas until about 1952.) But different reading sources had left me with enough detail about urban gang "zip guns" that I could roll my own.
</p><br>
<p>The wonderfully friendly owner of Rhodes and Tindall Hardware happily sold me a six inch length of 1/4 inch steel pipe. Ben Rhodes threaded one end and sold me a 1/4 inch pipe cap. Si Johnson, between customers at his filling station, drilled a 3/32" hole just at the point the cap screwed on tight. Clyde's handsaw, cut a handle from scrap wood and medical adhesive tape afixed barrel to handle. Carefully threading the fuse of a "Black Cat" firecracker from inside the barrel to outside charged my cannon. A steel ball bearing was the bullet. 
</p><br>
<p>Childhood friend, Jon Henderson, saw that the ball bearing penetrated 14 gage sheet steel. I was quite pleased with myself, I was the only boy I knew with his own handgun. 
</p><br>
<p>Not so very long after Clyde returned from work for the weekend, my gun disappeared. And I was given to understand that I could not do that again. The community had engaged in rearing a child. Likely I owe Ben or Si as well as Clyde thanks for preserving my right (aiming) eye, for the pipe cap could have failed under the pressure.
