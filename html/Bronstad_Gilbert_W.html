      <h3> The Clifton Record (a Bosque County, Texas weekly newspaper) recorded the comings and goings in quiet neighboring areas like Cranfills Gap; all the better to increase readership beyond Clifton, TX. I mined microfilm of the Clifton Record for family references. I saw slimmest images of my coming into the social awareness of the Gap, much as one might see, passing a wooden fence, a kinetoscopic view of a neighbors back yard. Slim little images my past like:  </h3>

 <div class="grid-item"><p>Context of Item 001</p>
<p>In a community like Cranfills Gap, very little went unnoticed. There were no Gestapo or NKVD spies earning their State Secutity keep, but there were neighbors who wanted to know which kin visited whom and where their neighbors had been the last two days.</p><br>
<p> Such information did not so much stabilize the state as sell the local weeklies, The <u>Clifton Record</u> or the <u>Meridian Tribune</u>. To me, <u>The Clifton Record</u> offered richer ore. There seemed to have been more Norwegian ties between Cranfills gap (the Gap) and Clifton than beween the Gap and Meridian.</p><hr>
<p>Experientially, as a child in Cranfills Gap, I found this community's neighbor nosiness oppressive. By way of example, like most boys I was very interested in guns. Natural enough; Cranfils Gap was distinctly rural; unlike Clyde's family, most families owned one or more firearms. High on the list of entertainment were western cowboy adventure movies and adventure themed radio; firearms often played a central r&ocirc;le. (Television had not penetrated to our area of Texas until about 1952.) But different reading sources had left me with enough detail about urban gang "zip guns" that I could roll my own.
</p><br>
<p>The wonderfully friendly owner of Rhodes and Tindall Hardware happily sold me a six inch length of 1/4 inch steel pipe. Ben Rhodes threaded one end and sold me a 1/4 inch pipe cap. Si Johnson, between customers at his filling station, drilled a 3/32" hole just at the point the cap screwed on tight. Clyde's handsaw, cut a handle from scrap wood and medical adhesive tape afixed barrel to handle. Carefully threading the fuse of a "Black Cat" firecracker from inside the barrel to outside charged my cannon. A steel ball bearing was the bullet. 
</p><br>
<p>Childhood friend, Jon Henderson, saw that the ball bearing penetrated 14 gage sheet steel. I was quite pleased with myself, I was the only boy I knew with his own handgun. 
</p><br>
<p>Not so very long after Clyde returned from work for the weekend, my gun disappeared. And I was given to understand that I could not do that again. The community had engaged in rearing a child. Likely I owe Ben or Si as well as Clyde thanks for preserving my right (aiming) eye, for the pipe cap could have failed under the pressure.

<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/03/books/pierre-nora-dead.html" target="_blank">Mr.[Pierre] Nora’s&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-external-link"> </i></a> major contribution to historiography was the concept of “lieux de mémoire” (“sites of memory”), a term he coined to describe elements of the past that a community chooses to remember and which become symbolic of a shared identity. Examples would be Joan of Arc, the national anthem “La Marseillaise” and the rooster — “le coq gaulois” — as an unofficial icon of France.
<br><br>
This concept has been highly influential in the field of memory studies, shaping discussions elsewhere in Europe, the United States and Asia about how memory functions in societies, particularly in how nations remember and forget.
<br><br>
At an individual level, much of my memory is attached to place; and if not place, to person.

<h4>1950-01-13</h4>
<p> 3rd grade: The sleet and ice made an interesting report for the weather chart the third grade is keeping.</p>
<Blockquote class="gwb">I had broken my foot, running up Dink Henderson's chicken coop with Jon Henderson. We were practicing flight. The 5<sup>th</sup> landing was a little rough for me; my left foot told me, "NO, Thou Shalt not Walk with Me."<br><br> 
I crawled back home, across Hwy 22 to gales of laughter from Jon and Mac, his older brother. They thought my act hilarious. <br><br>
With some difficuty, I gingerly mounted my bike at home (Homer's House) and limp-pedaled to the store where Clyde realized, indeed, I had a problem. <br><br>
The heavy plaster cast had been off for three days, I used a crutch to lessen weight on the tender foot. Then, one recess, the icy sidewalk showed me I had not mastered the crutch. That found a new expression of pain, rebreaking of a bone, one I care not to repeat, I couldn't cry out, I could only shiver. Six more weeks of plaster cast made for one strong if unballanced leg.
<br><br>
It seems prudent, if tardy, that 75 years later, I'm going for a bone density test.

<p> Why would you assume anything, Walt.  That's where we all go astray. -BH </u></p>
<br>
<p>We must make assumptions, there is no other path through life. We never had, never will have the the assurance of deductive logic to guide the least step in our lives, outside, perhaps geometry class. We assume the bridge we drive over is, if not up to it's latest government rating, at least capable of bearing the weight of our car. We assume the ground beneath our feet will hold  us today as surely as it did yesterday. 
</p>
<p>
Sometimes these assumptions prove wrong. Twenty or thirty years ago an indoor pedestrian bridge, high above a new Kansas City hotel lobby refuted such an assumption and a dozen or more fell to their death. From time to time a cave beneath someone's feet collapses and people, or animals fall to their death in sink holes. 
</p>
<p>
The best we can do is be aware of our assumptions, evaluate the risks and act within that framework.
</p>
<p>
We accept the views or news that agree with our preconceived notions and disregard all the views and news that doesn't. 
-BH  </p>
<p>
Up to a point, I agree with you completely. There do come times when evidence is so compelling that one must reconfigure one's conceptual structure. 
</p>
<p>
An easy example is my faith in the U. S. government. Age 26, working in Chicago, I got my draft notice. I was a little doubtful of the need to fight in Vietnam, but what did we have a government for? Did we not select the best and the brightest, to borrow JFK's (maybe Ted Sorenson's) term. 
</p>
<p>
Would not the best and the brightest navigate the ship of state surely and truly through the moral, political, and economic shoals? Had I not enjoyed the blessings of my country, was it not my obligation to serve when my country needed, even if that need was, paradoxicly, in a trans Pacific, 3rd world country I knew no more of than it's location on a map? 
</p>
<p>
Chicago had it's share of war protests; I studied a parade within the loop, protesting our growing involvement in the war, disappointed not to see a host of Marxist beards proving it's error. Enter the Army I did, so thoroughly entwined in my rational web was the certainty that my government knew better than I my own best interest. 
</p>
<p>
My OCS training company was a mixture of high-school grads, college grads, promising NCO's, east to west coast. In one class, believe it or not, they required a book report, I suppose they wanted to insure minimal literacy, among other qualities, befor issuing the certificate of rank.  
</p>
<p>
On rare leave I found Jean LaCoture "Vietnam: The Lessons of War". Vietnam and war was probably the next, possibly last punch on my ticket, looked like "must reading".
</p>
<p>
LaCoture convinced me the U.S. was there more by bull-blunder than fox-like craft. Fools get into restraining pens with bulls. The luster of gold bars began to tarnish before I could buy them. 
</p>
<p>
As graduation approached, Army-prison hold relaxed; we had to be innoculated for return to the world; miraculously, we could buy newspapers. It stunned me to see the name of a fellow student on page one of the New York Times. He was years ahead of me (in my abandoned academic aspirations), the golden haired boy of my academic adviser, Arthur Melton. 
</p>
<p>
Melton had been a general in the Air Force or Army, before retireing and relentlessly driving himself in a purely academic (Experimental Psychology) career at Michigan. Dale Noyd, Ph.d. in hand, went on to a teaching post at the new Air Force Academy. (Understand, he was already an Air Force pilot.)
</p>
<p>
The NY Times filled in the unknown steps in Noyd's life.  Needing pilots more than professors, the Air Force had reassigned Captain Noyd to Vietnam. He knew the war had evolved into situations where pilots had dropped ordnance on civilians. He'd asked to be reassigned to non-combat roles. The Air Force would not make an exception. Thus the court martial; he refused to sell his soul for his career. 
</p>
<p>
I cannot pretend I restructured my mental framework overnight. There is a lot of baggage in a 26 year old brain; had I been assigned to Vietnam, I probably could have killed a woman or child if I felt my life threatened. I admired Noyd, but was not up to his level of pluck, and far, far less likely to deposit massive ordnance on Hanoi schoolchildren in fifty milisecond of misjudgement. Luckily for me, the Army did not give me that test. I simply mourn for those so tested in Vietnam and Iraq.
</p>
<p>
Mourn and know the test was/is not necessary.  (As A J P Taylor argues in "The Origins of the Second World War", the fault for WW II lies less with Hitler's malignity and more with diplomatic blundering by Britain, France, and the U.S. It's largely that it is easier to sell history books that lay the blame on Germans than history books that deeply try to understand, "How can things go so colossaly wrong?".) 
</p>
<p>
Like A.J.P. Taylor, Ritter is in a better position to know. Yes, it is a kind of deference to authority, a kind of 'faith'. But it is not the total, evidenceless, mega carrot, mega stick faith of Christianity. Like witnesses at a trial, it involves factual, distinctive signs of credibility. Ritter was a U.S. representative on the U.N. weapons inspection team. Ritter was a U.S. Marine officer who had experienced warfare. Ritter had balls like few other men or women; who among us could have stood before the Iraqi congress, urging them to take action to avert the oncomming war? Unlike the neocons directing the debacle in Iraq, his experience of war is deeper than video games. He would not have said, as Pat Robertson avers George Bush told him at the outset of the war with Iraq, "There won't be any casualties."  
</p>
<br>
<p>
<u>I remember  trying to prove "once saved, always saved" to Jon  using scripture.  Of course, I did.  I couldn't  explain all of the scripture he cited that didn't  seem to fit in, but I didn't care, I had my verses  and experts, and that was all I needed.  There's so much to support each side that it just seems  pointless to jump on a bandwagon and just keep on  riding it no matter whether it's going to Heaven or  hell just because the driver happens to agree with  us. -BH</u>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Is it cruel of me to suggest there are many layers of assumption residing in the assurances of you hermeneutics?
</p>
<p>
There is for example the assumption that the hermeneutics you learned are the correct ones, an assumption that ought recognize countervailing winds from many other Christian denominations, not to mention non-Christian religions. 
</p>
<p>
Perhaps that is partly your point and I am too obtuse to recognize that. So let me go on to the bandwagon issue. 
</p>
<p>
Yes there is a danger riding in the band wagon. The distraction of the noise of the band can lead team, driver and band to grand mischance. Some of the band members, maybe percussionists who play intermittently ought divert their view from the cacophany and insure the wagon is not bound for the tar pit.
</p>
<p> Sincerely, Barbara
</p>
<p>
 <u>Hey, Walt, where do these people get all of this information? -BH</u>
</p><br>
<p>
 I'd assume that Scott Ritter has very close ties with   officials in the U S Government, the U N and perhaps  in Iraq. He has a record of courageously speaking  the  truth when our government was lying us into war.  Remember the 138,000 liters of anthrax and 2,000,000  pounds of deadly gas Saddam had on hand. Dick Cheney  knew where it was; they knew where to go and destroy  the WMD's. Ritter said it wasn't there; he tried to
 stop the war that has cost 100,000 Iraqi lives, 1500  American lives and 20,000 severely wounded. (e.g.  http://www.time.com/time/pow/article/0,8599,350809,00.html)
 </p><br>
<p>
 <u>I guess you can believe every bit of   propaganda that comes across the wire.   -BH</u>
 </p><br>
<p>
 Our great problem is that propaganda comes from the  media. Corporate giants own the media (Westinghouse, G.E, Disney, Time Warner, Rupert Murdoch, etc. They are not going to risk offending the administration; they have too much to lose.) Our tax dollars go to buying pundits who echo the party line. It's just like the Soviet Union propaganda machine with a Capitalist twist (i. e. no job security for the pundits other than continued pleasure of the boss. see
 http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-01-06-williams-whitehouse_x.htm)
 </p>
<p>
 <u>I plan to  give people in politics a chance.  - BH</u>
 </p><br>
<p>
 What is too much? At what point does one say, "You've blundered too far, George, you are wasting too much trying to cover past blunders, your efforts to correct yourself are just carrying us all down."   Are 100 American dead too many? 1000 too many. Will it take 10,000 American dead before we say "enough"? These are our children, our sisters our brothers our Fathers our Mothers who are killing and being killed. We are creating a festering sore both on ourselves (we've accepted the use of torture by redefining torture as "severe pain like the loss of an organ or death". O. K. guys at Abu Ghraib, don't torture,  just do what it takes to get the job done. Newspeak. Our wounded come home minus parts that formerly meant death. Some may not want to live. e.g. Chesty Puller's son after almost inconceivable wounds in Vietnam.)  When the WMD lie came to the light of day, George & co
 blamed the lie upon "intelligence failures"; he never publicly grappled with the possibilities that he was duped by Ahmad Chalabi, or that bureaucrats quickly learned what intelligence they were expected to find.   When U. S. Servicemen and women's photographs surfaced, showing them doing things that were certainly not as severe as causing the loss of an organ, the world properly recoiled in horror. Bush courageously used the service men and women as scapegoats. 
 </p>
<p>
  <u>No one can get  very much done on their own. It takes a lot of  people working a lot of hours to get even one little  bill passed in Congress...much less half way around  the world. I think I would rather take care of my  voting privileges here in the good ol USA and not  spend the precious hours God has given me to bad  mouth every thing the poor politicians try to do.  -BH</u>
 </p>
<p>
 In our form of government, these people, at least theoreticly, are our servants. When our servants misbehave, we are obliged to correct them, else we
 are equally guilty of the sin of omission.   
 </p>
<p>
 <u>It seem so pointless.  Barbara</u>
