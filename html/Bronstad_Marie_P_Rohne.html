<h4>1933-01-20</h4>
<p>Last Friday Otis Bronstad, Chris Rohne, Ed Skramstad, Johnnie Christenson and us went up to Meridian - just looking around. We found quite a lot of work being done on Highway 22, and the appearances are the road will be completed some time this year. They have two crews at work-one out of here and one from Meridian.  </p>
<h4>1933-01-20 </h4>
<h4>THUGS MAKE DAYLIGHT RAID ON THE CRANFILLS GAP BANK </h4>
<p>Two bandits looted the First Security state Bank at Cranfills Gap, 20 miles west of Clifton at noon Tuesday and escaped with $700, leaving Cashier Chris Rohne locked in the vault, whence they had forced him to get the money.</p>
<p>Mr. Rohne was out of the vault in three minutes, he said, but the bandits had escaped, driving west in an automobile and then turning south on the other side of the hill on which Cranfills gap is located. The south road connects with highway seven, and Rohne thought the men either drove to Brownwood or east to Waco, and he telephoned officers at these points.</p>
<p>
Mr. Rohne had just come in to open the bank after the lunch hour when he saw the two men standing on the sidewalk outside. He was suspicious of them and would not open the door. They then walked down the street to a drug store, which they entered and Rohne opened the door. He was alone in the bank.</p>
<p>
A few minutes later the two suddenly walked in, produced pistols and ordered the cashier to "stick- 'em up," which he did. They make him lie on the floor while they searched the teller's cage. Finding no money, they forced Rohne to get up and open the vault and the safe, but they overlooked more money than they took, Mr. Rohne said. The smaller of the two men seemed nervous and the robbery was hurriedly excited.</p>
<p>
The Cranfills Gap bank was robbed three years ago this March by burglars who burned trough the walls and the vault with a gas torch, and last week an unsuccessful attempt was made to break into the safe, the robbers knocking off the knobs, but failing to gain entrance.</p>
<p>
When Mr. Rohne first saw the two men and became suspicious of them he particularly noted their appearance and the appearance of the car. He described the automobile as being a gray Ford sedan, four doors, no rear number plates, the spare tire on the rear worn threadbare, both fenders dented.</p>
<p>The man who first produced a pistol and ordered him to put up his hands was described by Mr. Rohne as six feet tall, weight about 150 pounds, slender, dark, dressed in dark clothes, with a light hat. The other was five feet, 10 inches tall, weight 160, sandy-haired, dressed in khaki jacket and light blue work pants. The man was nervous.</p>
<p>S. C. Feiszell, the Wacoan whose automobile, stolen from him Monday night, was used by the two bandits who robbed the Cranfills Gap Bank, had his property back Wednesday night, but officers were apparently no nearer to the apprehension of the bandits. The stolen car was recovered near Gatesville by Sheriff W. W. Hollingsworth of Coryell County. The use of a Waco car was first suspected when Bosque county officers found a Waco High School tire cover in the brush near Cranfills Gap, where the Feiszell car and a blue sedan had been seen before the robbery. The officers believe the blue car was used for the latter part of the get-away trip. </p>

<h4>Mrs E. P. Rohne Dies, Many Descendants Left</h4>
<p>Marianne Olianne Egeberg Rohne was born May 24, 1858 at Loiten, Hedemarken, Norway. She was baptized in the Loiten Lutheran Church at infancy, and later confirmed in the same church by pastor Erickson. At the age of twenty she left Norway and came to Texas in 1878. She arrived at Mexia, where she joined her only brother, Bernt F Johnson. She was first employed at the estate of Col. Henry, a plantation near Mexia, and it was at this plantation residence she met Evan Paulson Rohne, to whom she was united in marriage Dec. 15, 1880. The wedding ceremony was performed at the Henry mansion. Following the wedding, the young couple made the trip to Bosque County in a covered wagon. They settled on a farm four miles southeast of Cranfills Gap where she resided until her death. Thus she lived at this homestead for sixty-seven years.</p>
<p>To this union nine children were born. Her husband preceded her in death on May 11, 1901. Three children, Minnie Mikelson, Cora Christenson and Oscar Rohne also preceded her in death. The surviving children are: Pauline, Mrs. Gus Knudson of Cranfills Gap; Emma, Mrs C. T. Jenson of Milan, Minn; Rev. J. Magnus Rohne of Terrace, Minn.; P. B. Rohne of Cranfills Gap with whom she resided at the time of her death; Helen, Mrs. J. Justin Jenson of Mount Belvieu, Texas, Chris L. Rohne of Cranfills Gap. Besides her surviving children, there are forty grandchildren and thirty-five great-grandchildren to mourn her passing. Another great grandchild, Troy Rohne, preceded her in death. Thus she was the progenitor of eighty-five direct descendants. from the second and third generation seventy-five out of the seventy-six survive.</p>
<p>Besides her own children Mrs. Rohne also took within her own flock a nephew, Charles O. Johnson, after the death of his mother in Dallas, at the time when he was only four months old. He remained in her home until he was four years old. The Rohne home too, was the first American home of other relatives, namely Pete Lahlum, August Lahlum, Martin Rohne and Olaf Rohne. for well over thirty years she cared for her own mother, until her death at the age of ninety-four on Aug. 4, 1911, whom she truly honored according to the fourth commandment.</p>
<p>Throughout her long and useful lifetime, she enjoyed remarkably good health. After her last illness of about ten days, she quietly and peacefully went to her eternal reward at 1:50 p.m. Tuesday, Feb. 25, 1947</p>
<p>"Grandma" Rohne, as she had been long and affectionately called, was an outstanding example of true Christian devotion, hope and faith. Since the loss of her husband in 1901, for 46 years, she was both father and mother to her large family. She was also an outstanding example of courage and determination. With a prayerful heart she traveled the difficult road. Moments of anxiety and moments of darkness seemed to melt in her presence. She seemingly had no fears. in the face of every obstacle, she maintained an unusual calmness of spirit. Her everlasting shield was her faith and trust in God, and her Saviour.</p>
<p>She held her active membership in the Lutheran Church since her confirmation, a period of approximately 73 years. This church she loved dearly. For 67 years she was a member of the local congregations, and took an active part in all church activities. Always she registered a particular and prayerful concern about the orphanages and old people' homes within the church. Too she was a very dear friend of Clifton College. In fact among her last statements was that "Clifton College has done a lot for me in the raising of my children."</p>
<p>Services were conducted Thursday afternoon, Feb. 27, 1946 at 2 0'clock from the P. B. Rohne home and at 2:30 at the local Lutheran Church, with her pastor, Rev. B. R. Maakestad, officiating, assisted at the church with opening scripture and prayer by rev. W. T. Gigstad of Clifton. The ladies' choir sang "Come Ye Disconsolate" and Mrs. B. R. Maakestad sang a beautiful solo, "Behind A Host Arrayed in White," both numbers very dear to the heart of the deceased during her life time.</p>
<p>Active pall bearers were E. P. Christenson, Glens Knudson, Cecil Rohne, Myron Jenson, Barbaran Johnson and Alton Aars.</p>
<blockquote class="gwb">One could imagine she would not take her leave of this life until she knew her family, her country, and her country of origin were safe and well. </blockquote>

<!--<h4>Clifton Record, 1941-05-02</h4> 

<p>Cranfills  Gap suffered the most serious fire loss in the business district this past week and has retarded the forward movement of this town for some time to come. A blaze of undetermined origin at about 10 o&rsquo;clock Tuesday evening, April 22, put the Anderson Food Store out of commission.  </p> 
<p>   Mr. Anderson has almost suffered a nervous breakdown, but he is a man of much courage and will soon be about some kind of business, but he is undecided yet what he will do. The building was owned by Mr. Otto Reesing but Mr. Anderson had been operating a successful food store there for a little more than a year.</p> 
<p>   The devastating fire in the store apparently started in the back of the building but soon spread to the front of the one-story structure. Help was called from Meridian and the fire fighters did a mighty fine job in extinguishing the fire in record time, and in saving the Helm Grocery, Wiley&rsquo;s café and Grimland&rsquo;s hardware store. The stillness of the night was a great help in stopping the rampage of the fire. Building and contents were partly covered by insurance.</p>

<h3>NON-WAR WORKERS PARASITES SAYS F.R. MUST LEAVE CAPITAL  </h3>
<p>WASHINGTON, Jan. 30.--President Roosevelt used blunt language Friday in warning individuals he described as parasites, persons living here only for social reasons, to move out of the national capital to make room for war workers who are arriving at the rate of 1,000 a week.<p>

<p>The press conference statement may or may not have sent shivers down the spines of socialites who can claim no war connection. But one thing was certain--it did bring relief to thousands of long-time natives who read morning headlines that they may be forced to leave the city if not engaged in essential wartime activities. . .</p>
