<h4>1925-10-23     Salute to Mr. Lars Olson</h4>
<blockquote class="clr">While walking out in his yard Monday of this week, Mr. Lars Olson received a fall which resulted in a sprained hip. However, after being given due medical attention, Mr. Olson is doing nicely. Mr. Olson is our oldest inhabitant, being close to ninety-five years of age, and has a remarkable memory that dates back to many an interesting event.<br>

<br>As a young man he entered the service of the Confederate army as a volunteer, but to this good day has never accepted a pension for his service, modestly feeling too patriotic to accept any aid from his State. At the age of 86 Mr. Olson, while coming to town one afternoon, in crossing Meridian Creek was caught in high water, washed down the stream, was tangled in barbed wire and suffered several hours of exposure in cold and rising water, but recovered without any lasting injury. Until last year Mr. Olsen was able to make two trips to town a day for his mail, and until then, signed his checks without glasses. We all wish Mr. Olson a speedy and complete recovery. 
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="gwb">
Uncle Chris Ludvig Rohne had begun writing Cranfills Gap news for the <u><b>Clifton Record</b></u>,<br><br> 
Many of his writings were worth remembering, like this one that signals a citizen worth remembering. Lars Olson. Let us remember both Chris and Lars.<br><br>

<h4>1925-12-18    Cranfills Gap Bootlegging?</h4>
<blockquote class="clr">It has been hinted to us that there is a good deal of bootlegging, making and drinking of home brew going on in and around our city. Personally, we are not in a position to deny or uphold the statement, primarily for the reason that bootleggers never come to us for advice, not do they report to us before going on duty. We can only say, if it is a fact, it is a dirty slam on our town, or any other town. But if it is a fact, it will not continue always. This is not a community to be bluffed by a set of bootleggers. When they will get enough of the dirty scandal, the people will enforce the law, and will arise to the occasion like an army -and some one will be handed a nice little penitentiary sentence - and it will not make much difference what his name is. We believe if it is a fact that these conditions exist, that the town and community will be cleaned up if it takes Ranger Captain Tom Hickman and others to do so. Our little city never has been wet and we do not believe it will be dampened by any little clique at this time...

<h4>1926-07-23</h4>
<p> Miss Lorena Bronstad, after spending a few days at the home of Mr. and Mrs. <b>Chris L. Rohne</b>, nursing little Lo Verne Marcell, who was severely burned week before last, returned to Waco Tuesday this week, where she will resume private nursing. Miss Bronstad, from January up to the time of coming home, had been with the Pure Oil Hospital of Mexia. She was accompanied to Waco by Mr. and Mrs. <b>Chris L. Rohne</b> and daughter Geraldine Elmira. </p>
<hr>
<h4>1927-03-25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Chris Rohne</b> writing for Clifton Record</h4>
<blockquote class="clr">Cranfills Gap, situated in a community of seven distinct farm incomes, wool, mohair, grain, poultry products, baby beeves, dairy products and cotton last Saturday shipped 1430 dozen -- 17,160 eggs -- of which 960 dozen -- 11,520 eggs -- were purchased from the farmers Saturday. This production is without a commercial chicken ranch in the community. This wealth is broadcasted, so to speak, in every farm home in the territory. We like to refrain from being boastful, although it is probably habitual--we wonder if there is another town in Texas that produces a similar amount of eggs in ration to its population, without commercial ranches. It at least emphasizes the pressing need of modern and large capacity chick hatchery for this town, to which the local Chamber of Commerce would heartily lend its encouragement. Before another season, we are certain such an enterprise will be properly established. We are wondering if the Texas-Louisiana Power Company which owns plants at both Hico and Clifton, will probably run a poser line through our city, connecting the two insuring power and light for several similar enterprises.

<p>Messrs W. T. Tergerson, Joe Dahl, and <b>Chris L. Rohne</b> were in Meridian Monday of this week going before the Commissioners' Court in the interest of retaining the Government trapper and also to have the county to pay two-thirds of the expenses one-third of which is aid by the Federal Government. The court was happily unanimous in favor of keeping the trapper, and paying the two-thirds. There have been 93 wolves and 18 bobcats caught by government trappers in our county in less than one year, and this {is} certainly a worth while undertaking.  </p>

<blockquote class="clr">A very sad and sudden gloom was spread over this section when news went out that Odin Jermstad had died at his home from an attack of heart failure. Mr. Jermstad had been to town the evening before, but never felt well the next morning and remained in bed. During the noon hour he was left in the house, taking care of his infant daughter. Before Mrs. Jermstad came in he had passed away. Mr. Jermstad had been treated for his heart for over two years, and had complained to his physician two weeks before of heart disorder. Nevertheless, his death was a terrible shock to all, but more especially to his mother [great aunt Georgina Jermstad] who was just coming from Fort Worth to spend the holidays with them, and came to the yard gate before she knew of his death, which had occurred while she was on her way from Meridian over here. Mr. Jermstad was 25 years of age last August, and was reared in this section. On Dec. 26, 1926 he was united in marriage to Miss Odie Willett of Murfreesboro, Ark. To this union one daughter was born, now an infant of only a few months. Besides his wife and baby, his father and mother, Mr. and Mrs. Charley Jermstad, two brothers, Menloe and Charles, and a host of more distant relatives survive him in this section. The remains were laid to rest Christmas day in the St. Olaf Cemetery with Rev. J. A. Urnes officiating. . .

<blockquote class="clr">A meeting was held in the Mustang school house Wednesday night of last week for the purpose of stimulating an interest in the "one variety of cotton movement." The meeting was a success both from the point of attendance and from a co-operative spirit. One variety of seed was decided upon, and a series of similar meetings is being planned for the different school districts, one of which was held at Boggy on Tuesday night of this week. With this movement originating from the proper source, among the farmers themselves, it is no reason why it should not meet with all success. The natural tendency that the introduction of good pedigreed seed should have upon production as a whole, no doubt will amply repay the efforts and money expended, the first year, conditions favoring.

<blockquote class="clr">The different committees met in the local bank Monday and turned in their cotton seed subscriptions for the one variety of seed. Money for 922 bushels was paid in thus giving the farmers a cut rate on their seed. Over a hundred farmers went into the movement. The Anton seed was selected.

Mr. Kirchman of the Lanham community was in town the first of the seek, dickering with Mr. Pederson for the local gin. He stated if he made the purchase that he would meet the demands of the new cotton movement.

In the Poultry and Livestock Show that was staged at Clifton Thursday, Friday and Saturday of last week, it was indeed a pleasure to see how well the Cranfills Gap community was represented. Our people exhibited a quality of stuff that would be a credit to any community, that won for them many first honors, and that gave them practical advertising the county over. But the big thing is that our people are quickly catering to the significance of improved live stock and poultryâ€”that they are a progressive type of people with a vision of prosperity. We are not in a position to give the names of all the winners, but we believe honorable mention should be made of Bennie Swenson of the boys club, who won a hold watch and $15.00 in money on his Aberdeen-Angus calf. This is the third time he has won first this fall.

<blockquote class="clr">All the club boys were at the Fat Stock Show last week exhibiting their car load of baby beeves. The boys came home mighty proud of the occasion having "run away" with $166 of Fort Worth prize money. They won first on carload lot, second in county group, eighth and twelfth on individuals. The work of the boys beside being both educational and a means of interesting the community in better livestock, has been a financial success. The work proved several interesting facts, but two in particular: First, that better livestock responds to feed at profitable margin; second, that feeding better livestock is a profitable method of marketing surplus feed on the farm. The boys are imbued with an enthusiasm that will no doubt double the club membership for another year. Mr. Johnson deserves special credit for the interest he has taken.
<br><br>
In speaking of the Stock Show, we feel that special mention should be made of J. W. Hutton & Son, northwest of town. Mr. Hutton won third, fifth and eighth on his Shorthorns in competition with Lookabaugh of Oklahoma, and Scofield of Hillsboro. Mr. Joe Hutton, the son, won the Packers Medal and Grand Champion on his baby beef, which combined amounted to $90.00. When sold, the calf brought 19 cents per pound, and together with the prize money, the boy realized $289.00 on his baby beef, a little over eleven months old.
<br><br>
Mr. James Knudson also won grand champion on his mutton, winning $12.00 in money and selling at 10 cents per pound. Together with the prize money the boy realized about $36.00 on his mutton.
<br><br>
Besides the club boys, those who attended the Stock from this section were: Ras Gaston, N. S. Swenson, A. S. Knudson, W. J. Russell, Chas. O. Johnson and <b>Chris L. Rohne</b>.

<blockquote class="clr">Monday morning Mr. John Pederson was found dead in his home on the S. C. Jermstad place on the mountain. Mr. Pederson had died some time after five o'clock Saturday afternoon, at which time he had been seen with practically no indication of a severe condition. He possibly died late Saturday afternoon or early Sunday morning. However, his watch had stopped; his unlit lamp was over half-full.
<br><br>
Thus, comes to a close the life of a man who had been done an untold injustice in this world. Mr. Pederson a newcomer in this country, not knowing the language, was sentenced to hang on circumstantial evidence of a murder in Fort Worth. Gov. Hogg, not seeing fit to have the gallows close the life of any man on circumstantial evidence only, commuted the sentence and gave him ninety-nine years imprisonment. However, a woman died who confessed to the murder for which he had been held guilty.
<br><br>
He was immediately pardoned by Gov. Colquitt but he was an old man, an outcast on the sea of life, the flower of youth and manhood having been sacrificed in innocence. After having gained his freedom he was possessed of too much pride and not enough money to return to the land of his relatives. He finally became a pauper, but left enough hard earned money to pay the county 100 per cent. Bosque county never lost a dollar.
<br><br>
Although no one would hold he state responsible for his imprisonment, it has been the general consensus of opinion that something worth while should have been done by the state to make his last days more pleasant. We can think of no greater misfortune befalling anyone. His body was laid to rest in the St. Olaf Cemetery in the presence of his close friends and county officials, Rev. J. A. Urnes officiating.

<blockquote class="clr">Cranfills Gap, April 16.â€”Today marked the closing of perhaps the most successful school term in our history. Under the able principalship of Prof. Anderson, our local school has elevated its standard of scholarship, has improved in the point of enrollment and attendance, and has developed that very essential thingâ€”the keen personal interest of the parents. No community can unanimously point to any one thing in particular with greater pride and satisfaction than to the high standards of its public school. The other members of the faculty were: Mrs. Bernt Bertelson and Misses Sorenson and Bjerke, It is hoped that the services of the same faculty may be secured for another year. . . .
<br><br>
In the issue of April 12th, of the "<u>Farm and Ranch</u>", there appeared a picture of the local club boys, together with an article commenting favorably on the work done. The picture was taken and the article produced by Mr. Tom Mann, field editor of the "<u>Farm and Ranch</u>", while the boys were attending the Ft Stock Show at Fort Worth. The fact that the work was done so satisfactorily as to receive outside comment has a tendency to make the boys take an even greater interest for another year.

<blockquote class="clr">The local orchestra went through a final rehearsal Monday night for its program to be given in the College Auditorium at Clifton Friday night of this week. The program consists of good standard selections and bids fair to meet every demand, It is hoped that the Clifton people will see fit to give the local orchestra its support, not only in view of the fact that this section has contributed much to the development of Clifton by the liberal donation to the college, which no doubt has been greatly appreciated; but also because the orchestra plays the best class of music of any in Bosque county. . . . .
<br><br>
County Agent Johnson, together with the writer, went to the Gleason farm Tuesday, where arrangements were made for twenty or more Aberdeen-Angus calves for the new Boys Baby Beef Club. It is possible that the local club, however, will have a membership of over thirty boys.
<br><br>
While here Mr. Johnson stated that the boys won remarkably well at Mineral Wells. Out of ten counties, and sixty boys competing, Bosque won first in the junior judging contest. On individual judging Ira Dahl of the Boggy community won second in the juniors, and Arnold Homerstad of Norse fourth in the senior. First second and third, however, were won by our county in the junior individual judging. This seems to reflect considerable credit to Mr. Johnson's efforts.
<br><br>
In co-operation with the local bank, Mr. Johnson will make a trip to Johnson county on Tuesday of next week to make a purchase of ten or more Jersey heifers for the distribution of farmers in this section. Should any more be interested in this movement at this time, they should report at the bank before next Tuesday.

<blockquote class="clr">The snow that fell over this section Friday night and Saturday before Christmas was the heaviest we have had in 56 years or even longer, according to the oldest settlers. According to Messrs. B. B. Swenson, M. Sorley and John Jenson, the snows reached over the boots on the level in 1873 and laid on the ground for three weeks. Of course there was no trouble to get the boot full this time. Mr. Ed Skramstad states that this was the largest snow, falling in one snow, that he has ever seen in this country or Norway. Personally having seen 115 days of straight sleighing weather in Iowa, we do not recall any one snow any deeper on the level it snowed here for 23 hours without interruption and settled 22 inches on the level. The thermometer reached 4 degrees below zero. The first cars that tried to get through the snow had a terrible time. It took the mail carrier several hours to make it to Clifton. It took Messrs. Clyde Tindall and Joel Grimland five and a half hours to come from Hamilton, enroute from Brownwood. The heavy snow should be the best sign of a good grain crop that we could wish for. Coming for Christmas, it added to the spirit of the occasion, and everyone seemed to be happy.

So many people who travel through this section rave about our scenery and here we never think of it, at least not as much as we could. Just scenery has made many sections famous, and with proper advertisement, we could likewise make capital stock out of this, our most abundant resource. It is often strangers on a visit who visualize the greatest opportunities of a section who develop the possibilities and transform waste into wealth.

<blockquote class="clr">And Saturday night of this week the local P. T. A. under the direction of Prof. Sven Hanson, presents the play, “No Account David” by Lillian Mortimer. This home talent play brings to memory “The Prairie Rose” and “The Old Oaken Bucket” which were played by home talent before the war, left an indelible impression in this section. There is nothing that affords as much entertainment as a good play, where every character is known, and fits the part. In this play for instance, picture Brose Oglesby as the hard–boiled Sheriff Barnes, with a mean duty to perform, or Miss Cowen as a professional vaudeville performer. And there is the satisfaction of knowing when one patronizes a home talent play, that he is contributing to some useful purpose. The local P. T. A. this year is contributing over $100 to the school. Tickets are being sold by the boys and girls for 15 and 25 cents, which will also be good for the Senior play next week, and if the seating capacity is taken up these tickets will gave preference at the Senior performance.

The baseball club drove down to Clifton in the mud last Saturday, to meet the fast Clifton College Cats on their own territory, and our boys were tickled to play on their good fast ground, because ours is a little soft. However, the Cats liked to beat our “socks off”. In fact if they had gotten only two more scores, they would have. But we only had two wrapped up for them to begin with. It was just a nice thin slice of breakfast bacon we got this time, but choice meat. Moorman, for the Cats pitched a nice game throughout and allowed only six hits, and getting ten strikeouts. If they could have hit Brummett we would not have had anything to write about. But they didn’t. Brummett struck out fifteen men, on a straight ball and they said he never had any smoke. He allowed five hits, hit one played, but walked no one. It was one of the best games of the season and everybody seemed to enjoy it very much. Final score Cats 2, Cranfills Gap 3. It was too wet to plow.

Ticket each for the first single and first double; Cranfills Gap Drug Store, ticket each for the first triple and for the first bunt beat out; M. T.

<blockquote class="clr">The political pot of Bosque county which thus far has been simmering slowly, without any apparent sensation, Monday of this week received new color and new life, with the announcement that Prof. Sven Hanson, superintendent of the local school for the past season, has announced as a candidate for County Superintendent of Public Instruction, Prof. Hanson is a son of Mr. H. N. Hanson, the veteran stockman and farmer of the Mustang community, a grand and respected citizen of Bosque county. Hanson, the candidate, was born on Route 2, Meridian, in the Mustang voting precinct, finished his high school training at Clifton, and a superintendent of the local school the past term, he commands a triangular constituency that will sedge nicely into the voting population of Bosque county. But his qualifications will make its appeal everywhere, because especially in the field of education, the tax-payer demands that he who aspires to that office should himself be equipped with an education that needs no apologies, both because of the assistance he should be in a position to render the younger teachers of the county, as well as in the administration of the finances of his office. Mr. Hanson received his Bachelor of Arts degree in Iowa, did post graduate work at the University of Wisconsin, took a year at the University of Minnesota, and later took a special course in school supervision and administration at the University of Southern California. Last year the State University of Texas issued him a Permanent Teachers Certificate immediately upon presenting his credentials. He has had eighteen years of school experience in the States of North and South Dakota and Texas. For three summers he worked in the County Superintendent’s office in Bowman county, North Dakota. Mr. Hanson is middle-aged. Young enough to be energetic, aggressive and ambitious, old enough to possess the necessary experience Here is a man who has specialized in the field of education, and dedicated his life to it. And like every man born with a Texas instinct, it will drive him home. And with no apologies, Texas today offers the greatest field of opportunity of any state in the Union. Here is a man who has been driven home by the hunger and love for the beautiful hills of Bosque. And just as we would like to call home all the Bosque boys who have made an impression in the world, and give them a glad hand of welcome, just so Mr. Hanson will receive a welcome from the voters of the county.

<blockquote class="clr">One of the biggest, slowest and finest rains in several years fell over this section from Saturday until Monday noon. The rain has been estimated to be from seven to ten inches and an inch or two more or less is not so important, when everybody had rain to spare. The rains fell so steadily that the creeks never came on a rise until Monday, when most streams were out of bank. All pails and buckets out in the open, under a foot high, were overflowing. Farmers who sowed oats Friday stated they were up Tuesday - Men who are entirely reliable. Any damage that may be done to the cheap cotton, will no doubt be offset by the assurance of green winter pastures. The depression in the livestock market in 1925 was alleviated by large fall rains, and it is possible that a similar situation is "mobilizing." Economists have predicted that price levels after scraping the bottom for several months, were due to have an upward tendency around Oct. 1st, as a probable starting point. If this rain has had latitude enough to wash away the pessimistic undertone throughout the nation, we believe this statement is correct. Needless to say, the rain that fell declared dividends that runs into millions of dollars in Texas alone.

<blockquote class="clr">It seems that night basketball has taken the “night” here. Friday night of last week the fast Clifton College “Cat” team came out with a nice aggregation of material that looked good enough to bring home the bacon on any good dry court. But it rained again, and we have always had good luck playing the Cats on a wet ground. They have always had the best team, but when it’s wet, we win. Three of the home boys play on the Cat teams, and they are good boys, too. In fact, we have always furnished from three to nine players on the Cat teams depending on the sport. Incidentally we have furnished catchers on the Cat baseball team for about the last eight seasons. It is indeed strenuous to make a decent write-up when you want both teams to win. We wouldn’t wish to say a work that would offend any of these boys. Anyway, we send the Cats the best we have, and with what we have left, we beat their “socks off.” Cats 11, Cranfills Gap 23. Goo0d game.

Likewise, and in the same manner, the girl Cats played the local high school girls Thursday night of last week. And like the Cat team, it was composed of a preponderance of local material " kittens" who have made good in the Cat class. This was a red hot game and offered many spectacular thrills, Score: College 8; Cranfills Gap 16.

So we come to the game of Tuesday night of this week, also on the local court between the Clifton town team and the locals. Both teams were evenly matched and close guarding by both sides prevented any large runs of scores. It was more of a defensive affair and did not offer any sensations to speak of. The local team again preserved the bacon by a score of 14 to 9. In less than a week the locals have defeated the Clifton boy Cats and girl Cats and town cats, and it’s not a cat town either. Anyway the railroad never did make a basketball team. . . .

<blockquote class="gwb"> .This cracks me up each time I read it. I’m not sure of how aware Uncle Chris was of the historical irony of the weaker sex expected to play well through January rain. Maybe expectations for children were far more strongly colored by the childhood of the settlers from the old country.

I try to imagine the game; I see girls at a pressed play, each recalculating the bargain they made to be part of a team; many to avoid the boredom and labor of evening chores one or twice a week. Trying to dribble a ball grown vile and unresponsive with a coat of cold mud probably gags-out the college girls first. Most came from the city and hadn’t learned to kick barn-yard shit off their boots and keep on with the work at hand.

<p>Messrs. Felix Shaffer, Burrell F. Word, Jim Brown, Chas Danaby and <b>Chris L. Rohne</b>, motored to Austin last Friday in the interest of Highway No. 22. The purpose of the mission was to secure an appropriation out of the maintenance fund to start the actual construction of the airline road as soon as the right-of-way can be secured. Possibly six miles of the 100 foot right of way has already been secured, and in the present depression, it was felt that immediate construction would relieve some unemployment. The delegation was ably assisted in presenting their request by Hon. Earle B. Mayfield and Senator Carl Hardin of Stephenville. Had we secured the right-of-way when this road was surveyed two years ago, the Chief Engineer informed us that $47,000.00 would have been available immediately for construction purposes. And possibly, we lost as much the second year or more. In other words, we have let possible $100,000.00 slip between our fingers, money spent between Cranfills Gap and Meridian, because we were not ready to act. Now we can possibly get a right-of-way. but that sum of money is not available except by special concession. The Chief Engineer also stated that $31,000,000.00 worth of bonds have been voted by other counties, depending on the Highway Department to match that sum of money and of course in justice to these counties who are willing to burden themselves with heavy bond they must come first. Let it be known however that our delegation stated plainly that we would not vote bonds to get any appropriation. We mention this because we do not with the property owner to be led to believe that they will also have to vote bonds. The Highway Department itself does not favor the voting of bonds by districts . . .  </p>

<blockquote class="clr">The bandits that swooped down upon our town in the quiet hours of last Wednesday night and burglarized six of our business firms, rivaled in daring the exploits of the early West. It seemed to have been a calm and unexciting affair, however for the opposition encountered. But it must have been equally disappointing, considering the small loot ob rained for the amount of effort expended. It has been conceded since our first report, that the bank was attempted first, that the acetylene torch did not function properly either burning out the tips or the tubes as they evidently started out with their own complete outfit, including their own oxygen tank. When trouble set in they broke into Gaston Larson and Sorenson filling station for repairs. Only the torch proper and tips were stolen from Sorenson and brought to the bank. Only shellac and tape were stolen from Gaston and Larson also brought to the bank. Sorenson's was a welding torch not a cutting torch and the job seemed to have failed. When Mrs. Pederson's store was burglarized they were evidently disgusted as her cash register was thrown on the concrete floor several feet away, making a noise that should seem inconsistent for a well organized job. The post office safe was broken open with a sledge hammer or other tool, possibly at about the same time. At the bank the combination was burned off the main vault and the knob knocked on the customer's vault door. The safe was burned thru and between then and twelve gallons of water poured through the opening to prevent the money from burning up. In spite of the water, much of the currency, about $1000 was burned around the edges, but not beyond redemption. Only 66 dollars were a total loss due to the fire. no customer papers were destroyed. All money loss and property damage to the bank is fully covered by insurance. The loss at the post office in money was$39.00 which is covered by insurance but the save was individual property and was the loss of Mrs. Laura Hall, local postmistress. Mrs. Pederson lost thirteen dresses and some ladies underwear. The garages lost only a few small articles other than mentioned, including some gasoline at Gaston's station. Sheriff L. S. Lewins of Meridian and Mack Morgan of Hamilton sere summoned over. Detectives Buchanan and O'Brien of Waco and a representative from the Burns detective Agency, Dallas were out. The job did not bear all the ear marks of a professional. At this time there is a strong clue developing and we would predict that the gentlemen will be caught. We believe our officers will keep their trail hot until Justice has run its course. We wish to say that customers of the bank were very courteous and patient, in allowing the bank sufficient time to check, and everyone offered to be friendly and helpful in every way, which was highly appreciated by the officers an directors. A bank is a community institution and when it is robbed it kindles the wrath of all and should a daylight hold-up ever occur there are several who would try to collect a $5,000 reward. . . .

<p>Messrs. O. J. Bronstad , Clyde Tindall, Clyde Bronstad, and <b>Chris L. Rohne</b> attended the annual meeting of the Bosque Valley Fish and Game Protective Association at Valley Mills Thursday night of last week. This association has members from all the owns along the Bosque river and its tributaries as well as many farmers who are interested in the preservation and restocking of fish, to the end that the Bosque Valley will eventually be a fisherman’s paradise.. Likewise it is interested in the preservation and restocking of our country with game life. We have been promised a dam or two on Meridian Creek to help sustain the stream with sufficient water during the summer months in order that no fish may be lost through lack of water. Meridian Creek is a beautiful, clear water stream that will be a wonderful breeding place for bass and other fish. </p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THUGS MAKE DAYLIGHT RAID ON THE CRANFILLS GAP BANK </h4>
<p>Two bandits looted the First Security state Bank at Cranfills Gap, 20 miles west of Clifton at noon Tuesday and escaped with $700, leaving Cashier <b>Chris Rohne</b> locked in the vault, whence they had forced him to get the money.</p>
<p>Mr. Rohne was out of the vault in three minutes, he said, but the bandits had escaped, driving west in an automobile and then turning south on the other side of the hill on which Cranfills gap is located. The south road connects with highway seven, and Rohne thought the men either drove to Brownwood or east to Waco, and he telephoned officers at these points.</p>
<p>
Mr. Rohne had just come in to open the bank after the lunch hour when he saw the two men standing on the sidewalk outside. He was suspicious of them and would not open the door. They then walked down the street to a drug store, which they entered and Rohne opened the door. He was alone in the bank.</p>
<p>
A few minutes later the two suddenly walked in, produced pistols and ordered the cashier to "stick- 'em up," which he did. They make him lie on the floor while they searched the teller's cage. Finding no money, they forced Rohne to get up and open the vault and the safe, but they overlooked more money than they took, Mr. Rohne said. The smaller of the two men seemed nervous and the robbery was hurriedly excited.</p>
<p>
The Cranfills Gap bank was robbed three years ago this March by burglars who burned trough the walls and the vault with a gas torch, and last week an unsuccessful attempt was made to break into the safe, the robbers knocking off the knobs, but failing to gain entrance.</p>
<p>
When Mr. Rohne first saw the two men and became suspicious of them he particularly noted their appearance and the appearance of the car. He described the automobile as being a gray Ford sedan, four doors, no rear number plates, the spare tire on the rear worn threadbare, both fenders dented.</p>
<p>The man who first produced a pistol and ordered him to put up his hands was described by Mr. Rohne as six feet tall, weight about 150 pounds, slender, dark, dressed in dark clothes, with a light hat. The other was five feet, 10 inches tall, weight 160, sandy-haired, dressed in khaki jacket and light blue work pants. The man was nervous.</p>
<p>S. C. Feiszell, the Wacoan whose automobile, stolen from him Monday night, was used by the two bandits who robbed the Cranfills Gap Bank, had his property back Wednesday night, but officers were apparently no nearer to the apprehension of the bandits. The stolen car was recovered near Gatesville by Sheriff W. W. Hollingsworth of Coryell County. The use of a Waco car was first suspected when Bosque county officers found a Waco High School tire cover in the brush near Cranfills Gap, where the Feiszell car and a blue sedan had been seen before the robbery. The officers believe the blue car was used for the latter part of the get-away trip. </p>

<h4>Beloved Citizen of Clifton Gives Report On Early Days Of City's Development - 1954-04-30 <u>Clifton Record</u></h4>
<p>(Editor's note: The following in formation was written about Clifton by Mrs. O. P. Pederson who still resides in Clifton, for the edification of the cornerstone of the present City Hall here on October 10, 1924; Mrs Pederson is a daughter of Colonel and Mrs. J. M. Partlow who made their home in Clifton.)</p>
<p>The History of Clifton may be divided into two parts vis: That of Old Clifton and that of New Clifton.</p>
<p>The old town was founded in 1856 about a mile north of the present site but was moved in the course of a few years; the reason for such being given below.</p>
<p>The first building in Clifton besides the homes of the settlers was an old water mill which was owned and operated by Mr. Stinnett, father of Mrs. Billy Kemp. Later, due to an increase in the number of customers and also to the need of a more substantial building, the log mill was torn down and replaced by a rock building which was very much better equipped for grinding wheat than the first one had been. The Dam which also was made of logs was removed and a new one constructed of rocks. The new water mill which is known as "The Old Mill" was built in 1868 and was run by Mr. Hall. The millers who following him are Jim Whittington Richardson and Anderson partners, B. M. Boyd, and T. O. Swenson, son of Mrs. Alex Swenson of Clifton. After the mill ceased to be used as a flour mill it was leased and used as an electric power plant for a number of years from which source Clifton received power for its first electric lights. When a new power plant was constructed in Clifton,the Old Mill was left standing idle for several years when it was sold to one of the citizens who did away with the building, selling the rock out of which it was made for foundations, etc.</p>
<p>Clifton's interest in education was first manifested when the three story rock building was built which is still standing at the site of old town a mile north of the present Clifton. This was not the first, the first was a small frame structure located sometime during the early '60's on the bend of "Clear Branch," a mile north of the Rock Building. Among the first teachers of this school were professors Allen, Abney, Thominson, and McSpadden, grandfather of Joe K. McSpadden of Clifton.</p>
<p>As the settlement grew, so grew the need for a better and larger school, so in 1870 land for the three story Rock school building was donated by J. M. Locker. The two lower stories of the building were used for school purposes, while the third was a masonic Hall. Religious services and worship were also conducted in this building until churches were erected. Professor Perry stepfather of Will and Miss Clara Mixon of Clifton, was first instructor in the Rock Building.Others were Professors Culberson, Lomax Brothers, Sorrelle, Bewley Middleton, Spenser, Menefee and Kendrick Bewley the son in law of F. M. Kell Sr.</p>
<p>The town was divided by the Bosque River, across which there was no bridge except a wooden foot bridge.</p>
<p>
On the south side of the river was located the main business section of the town. The chief businessmen were Billy Kemp, general Merchandise, J. S. Sedberry, groceries, Billy Thomas, dry goods, Bertland blacksmith, G Grimland, blacksmith, F. Johnson, blacksmith, Frank Browning, drugs, William G. Shelstead, carpenter, Captain Etheredge, general merchandise, Mr. Sorenson, bakery, and Colonel Maples, general merchandise.</p>
<p>On the north side of the river were the school building, "Grandpa" Jones Hotel, J. M. Locker's cotton gin and T. O. Prather, General merchandise,and the United states Post Office.</p>
<p>Foremost Among the doctors of the Old town were Drs. Tergerson, Parshall, and Hatton.</p>
<p>
All merchandise and supplies were conveyed by means of ox wagons from Waco, Marlin and Millican and sometimes from Houston. later on mules were used instead of oxen.</p>
<p>Passengers and mail going and coming from Clifton were carried by means of a "Stage Line" from Waco to Meridian.</p>
<p>The Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railroad in 1880 bought a tract of land from F. M. Kell Sr., father of Mrs. Emma Mixon, and built its Depot about a mile south of Old Clifton. The distance of the Depot from the town made it necessary for merchants in the Old town to move their businesses nearer the Railroad. So in 1881 the first new business house in New Clifton was built by A. H. Hutchins of Galveston, and managed by Mr. McLemore. A new business added to the town at this time was a lumber yard by Mr. Kidd of Waco, managed by C. A. Poulson of this city and father of Mrs. Olena Poulson.</p>
<p>It was not until the spring of 1882 that the merchants of Old Clifton moved to New Clifton. The Billy Kemp residence was moved to New Clifton and converted into the "Kemp Hotel". At this time Clifton boasted two hotels, the Kemp hotel and the Kell Hotel, respectively, both on the east of the railroad.</p>
<p>In addition to the merchants moving from Old town, new business firms were established among which were W. H. Quigg & Co., Forbes & Bayles, W. P. Bilbert, Hardiman & Waters, Judge A. Stroop, A. W. Potts, J. B. Pool, Charles Harrington, Peterson & Grimland, Pierson Peterson & Co., A. P. Anderson, C. O. Nelson, Sears & Kemp, Shcow Bros., Nelson Bros., and Lockett & Bass. The last named firm occupied the first stone building which was erected in Clifton by Judge Stroop and which is the building nearest the Santa Fe Station in the Rea block and which was later occupied by Schow Brothers (Now east of Watson Feed And Hatchery).</p>
<p>The Baptist Church was the first erected in Clifton about 1884-85. All denominations used this church for their worship until it burned. The next Church built was the Presbyterian, closely followed by a Christian Church. These Churches were used by other denominations until several years later.</p>
<p>The town was named by Judge William R. Sedberry Sr., father of Mrs. E. E. Major. However this town was not named for a town in England as was stated in a previous history of the town but was given the name merely because Judge Sedberry admired it. Thus was Clifton begun.</p>
<p>The growth of this town had the changes in businesses have been so numerous that it would be useless to attempt to enumerate them. However,it will not be out of place to state that Clifton now boasts of one of the best high schools in the state for a town of its size. The school is a splendidly [?] one that carries an enrollment of near six hundred. It is well equipped in every department and has a beautiful Home Economics.</p>

<h3>Who lived Where-Their Occupation In "Old Town" Clifton</h3>
<p>Editor's Note: The following information was received for this edition through the courtesy of Miss Ruby Mixon, of Fort Worth, a daughter of Francis Marion Kell, early Clifton settler.</p>
<p>Miss Mixon also enclosed a map of the settlement at Old Town in Clifton's early days. This map shows the old Gunarus Shefstead home . . .</p>
<p>Dr. J. H. Hatton and his family lived across the road from the Kemp home. He was one of Clifton's early doctors. He owned quite a bit of land north of Clifton. His daughter, Mrs. Anna Hatton Driscoll, of Hico, made frequent visits to Clifton throughout her lifetime prior to her death several years ago.</p>
<p><u>The father of Steve Sargent (colored) lived in a log cabin in this vicinity. Steve married Beulah Bean, daughter of Frank and Patsy Bean, who long lived in the Norwegian community. Frank, who could speak Norwegian and was married in a Lutheran Church, is said once to have told a party of newly-arrived immigrants, who wanted to know how long he had been in America, that he had been here quite a while and that when they had been here as long as he had they would be as black as he was.</u></p>
<blockquote class="gwb">An amusing joke; the prolog was striking. Frank Bean had to have lived amont Norwegians a considerable time to speak Norwegian. More telling is the sugestion that he may have belonged to the Lutheran Church. If so, did not the Southern Whites correct the Lutheran congregation about the subordination of Afro Americans? You couldn't just bring European Christianity across the Atlantic to the South without some adjustments.
</blockquote>
<p>William Kemp kept a store across the road from the Old Mill. He sold sugar, coffee, tea, salt, and other staples; most people, however, freighted six months' to a year's supply of merchandise from Waco; some went even to Galveston by wagon to buy supplies. Sugar and flour by the barrel and cloth by the bolt were usual quantities stocked for a family use. Chris Pederson was a freighter in those days. . . .</p>
<p>William (Billy) and Sally Whittington from Mississippi at one time operated the Old Mill and lived south of the structure. They brought one former slave woman, Rachel, mother of 22 children with them to Texas; she lived in a cabin back of the Whittington residence.</p>

<h3>Early Colored Folks Of Bosque County (By Ella Robinson)</h3>

<p>There were quite a few colored slaves in Bosque County at the close of the Civil War. Some went back to the states from whence they came, while quite a few of them remained and worked on with their former owners, bought land, built homes for themselves, and reared their families.</p>
<p>Some of these families are yet living in the county. Bessie Jackson is the oldest living woman who was born in the county - in the Morgan community. Her grandparents were owned by the Rogers family of Morgan; all lived at Kimball Bend until the town of Morgan was organized. Uncle Tom and Aunt Clara Corsey and Aunt Mina, Lindy, Mary, Rose Evelyn, and Uncle Tom Jay were slaves here and each had large families.</p>
<p>They helped to clear the Bosque and Brazos Valley land for farming and made good farmers themselves, as that was the chief industry.</p>
<p>The colored men fought the Indians with the whites.</p>
<p>They had their camp meetings and began to organize churches- a colored Baptist Church was organized in Morgan in the early '70's. In Meridian a Cumberland Presbyterian Church and a Baptist Church were organized in 1979.</p>
<p>In Clifton the Beans, Garretts, Sedberrys, Tylers, and Jacksons were the first colored settlers. Some of their descendants are yet living here.</p>
<p>In Valley Mills the Sadlers were owned by a Dr. Sadler prior to the Civil War. Other early colored families were the Sintys, the Bibles, the Bashams, the Locks, and the Odies. East of Valley Mills the Downings were owned by the Downings early in the county history.</p>
<p>A Dr. Bateman, who lived around Kopperl, brought the Aunt Jane Robinson family to near Meridian before the Civil War; their owners became the Ridley Robinsons. The Crawfords were owned by the William Rush family, he being Bosque County's second county judge.</p>
<p>The first colored school was in Meridian and was taught by a white man. The first colored teacher was Uncle Pete Robinson. The Blue Book speller, from which he taught spelling, reading and numbers, was his only book; he had learned to read and write while a slave. Mrs. Mary Crawford was the last teacher.</p>
<p>There were other schools built for the colored in each of the towns of Morgan, Clifton, and Valley Mills and of the Cedron, Fowlere, and Rock Springs communities, as the county after the Civil war was thickly populated with colored people. All are now consolidated into three schools-Meridian, Clifton , and Valley Mills.</p>
<h3>Carl Questads settle At Norse; House Still Stands.  (By Mrs. Ole J. Hoel)</h3>

<p>Carl Ingbretsen Questad and his wife, Gisel Oldsdatter, sister of Jens Ringness, came from the Questad farm in Loiten, Hedemarken, Norway. They were among a group of emigrants who braved the unknown future in Texas for the sake of better opportunities for their children-a son, Evan, and a daughter, Martha.</p>
<p>They sailed from Oslo (Christiana) in 1851 in a small boat that was previously owned. After approximately two months upon the high sea, they reached their destination-New Orleans. From there they went to Four Mile in Kaufman County. In the red soil of the lowlands of east Texas, they suffered bitter disappointment, deprivations, and illness</p>
<p>To quote from notes (date unknown) on "On Norwegian Settlements In Texas For The Norwegian-American Historical Association." Axel Arneson of Fort Worth wrote that in 1853, Carl Questad was one of a group of men who set out to explore the land west of the Brazos. "Riding on a mission, to them as weighty as that of the spies of Israel searching out the promised land, one can easily sense the story. Coming to the brakes at the edge of the hills over looking Bosque valley there unfolded to them one of the most beautiful visions of nature. No wonder they were seized with emotion almost religious reverence. There below them lay untouched by human hand the goodly land, fairer than they had dreamed. And wonder of wonders! This was only an introduction to a multiplicity of other valleys, one beyond the other, each separated by a range of hills - mountains they call them. As they rode on over successive ranges, feasting eyes on intervening valleys, each seemingly more charming than the other, a unanimous conviction decided once for all that here and here alone would they cast their lot and rebuild their homes.</p>
<p>The Questads established a home place at Norse. They built a number of small houses of native stone, and these are the only ones that have been occupied continuously as a residence for the past century. Questad Place has remained in the family.</p>
<p>The son, Evan, died at the age of twenty. The daughter, Martha married Eric Swenson. They had five children, Charles E. Swenson of Yuma Arizona, Selma, who married Ollinus E. Schow; the late Tilden O. who married Alma Peterson, Belinda N,. who passed away in 1951; and Sadie J., who married Ole J. Hoel.</p>
<p>We know that these pioneers were courageous, resourceful, and self–reliant; but what manner of personalities did they have?</p>
<p>The same source quoted above tells us that "Carl Questad was a man of many points,of unusual intelligence, a student all his days, a collector of books, rare in extent and quality, when books were scarce. These he loaned freely to hungry-minded folks -the writer feels deeply grateful to his memory. He maintained a smithy on his farm, where it was his pleasure to do blacksmithing for the settlers without charge, and,finishing the job, he would bid them to his house for meals, or join in a pleasant talk over afternoon coffee."</p>
<p>In his obituary, written by Ole Canuteson, for the "Decorah Posten," we find that he died December 13, 1886, at the age of 71. Mr. Canuteson writes:</p>
<p>"Our departed countryman and friend deserves a more special remark from our hand. He was one of those noble characters, who we so very rarely meet. He and his good wife have in the many years they have lived here shown a rare hospitality and gave lodging and food to all who came their way, and they were many. Both known and strangers, rich and poor, especially the last named. If anyone was in need, Questad was ready to help.</p>
<p>"He was a man who for his station in society possessed more than common knowledge. He had clear judgement and understanding of the order and laws of nature and was one of the few in our midst who had a thorough knowledge of Norway's history and had acquired by reading and research and a clear insight in our ancestor's deeds, customs, religion, etc. He was especially interested in history and science.</p>
<p>"When I visited Norway in 1884, I saw in a cabinet at the museum in Bergen several petrified specimens on which it was written that they were sent there by Carl Questad, Clifton, Texas, America.</p>
<p>"He was also the leader in the movement to erect a monument on the grave of Cleng Peerson, the first Norwegian emigrant to the U. S. A. in 1821. The stone of Italian marble 12 feet high on the pedestal of limestone now stands complete on old Cleng's grave, and he had the satisfaction to see this, his dearest wish, carried out before he himself passed away. . . O. Canuteson."</p>

<h4>Mrs E. P. Rohne Dies, Many Descendants Left</h4>
<p>Marianne Olianne Egeberg Rohne was born May 24, 1858 at Loiten, Hedemarken, Norway. She was baptized in the Loiten Lutheran Church at infancy, and later confirmed in the same church by pastor Erickson. At the age of twenty she left Norway and came to Texas in 1878. She arrived at Mexia, where she joined her only brother, Bernt F Johnson. She was first employed at the estate of Col. Henry, a plantation near Mexia, and it was at this plantation residence she met Evan Paulson Rohne, to whom she was united in marriage Dec. 15, 1880. The wedding ceremony was performed at the Henry mansion. Following the wedding, the young couple made the trip to Bosque County in a covered wagon. They settled on a farm four miles southeast of Cranfills Gap where she resided until her death. Thus she lived at this homestead for sixty-seven years.</p>
<p>To this union nine children were born. Her husband preceded her in death on May 11, 1901. Three children, Minnie Mikelson, Cora Christenson and Oscar Rohne also preceded her in death. The surviving children are: Pauline, Mrs. Gus Knudson of Cranfills Gap; Emma, Mrs C. T. Jenson of Milan, Minn; Rev. J. Magnus Rohne of Terrace, Minn.; P. B. Rohne of Cranfills Gap with whom she resided at the time of her death; Helen, Mrs. J. Justin Jenson of Mount Belvieu, Texas, <b>Chris L. Rohne</b> of Cranfills Gap. Besides her surviving children, there are forty grandchildren and thirty-five great-grandchildren to mourn her passing. Another great grandchild, Troy Rohne, preceded her in death. Thus she was the progenitor of eighty-five direct descendants. from the second and third generation seventy-five out of the seventy-six survive.</p>
<p>Besides her own children Mrs. Rohne also took within her own flock a nephew, Charles O. Johnson, after the death of his mother in Dallas, at the time when he was only four months old. He remained in her home until he was four years old. The Rohne home too, was the first American home of other relatives, namely Pete Lahlum, August Lahlum, Martin Rohne and Olaf Rohne. for well over thirty years she cared for her own mother, until her death at the age of ninety-four on Aug. 4, 1911, whom she truly honored according to the fourth commandment.</p>
<p>Throughout her long and useful lifetime, she enjoyed remarkably good health. After her last illness of about ten days, she quietly and peacefully went to her eternal reward at 1:50 p.m. Tuesday, Feb. 25, 1947</p>
<p>"Grandma" Rohne, as she had been long and affectionately called, was an outstanding example of true Christian devotion, hope and faith. Since the loss of her husband in 1901, for 46 years, she was both father and mother to her large family. She was also an outstanding example of courage and determination. With a prayerful heart she traveled the difficult road. Moments of anxiety and moments of darkness seemed to melt in her presence. She seemingly had no fears. in the face of every obstacle, she maintained an unusual calmness of spirit. Her everlasting shield was her faith and trust in God, and her Saviour.</p>
<p>She held her active membership in the Lutheran Church since her confirmation, a period of approximately 73 years. This church she loved dearly. For 67 years she was a member of the local congregations, and took an active part in all church activities. Always she registered a particular and prayerful concern about the orphanages and old people' homes within the church. Too she was a very dear friend of Clifton College. In fact among her last statements was that "Clifton College has done a lot for me in the raising of my children."</p>
<p>Services were conducted Thursday afternoon, Feb. 27, 1946 at 2 0'clock from the P. B. Rohne home and at 2:30 at the local Lutheran Church, with her pastor, Rev. B. R. Maakestad, officiating, assisted at the church with opening scripture and prayer by rev. W. T. Gigstad of Clifton. The ladies' choir sang "Come Ye Disconsolate" and Mrs. B. R. Maakestad sang a beautiful solo, "Behind A Host Arrayed in White," both numbers very dear to the heart of the deceased during her life time.</p>
<p>Active pall bearers were E. P. Christenson, Glens Knudson, Cecil Rohne, Myron Jenson, Barbaran Johnson and Alton Aars.</p>
<blockquote class="gwb">One could imagine she would not take her leave of this life until she knew her family, her country, and her country of origin were safe and well. </blockquote>

<h4>Beloved Citizen of Clifton Gives Report On Early Days Of City's Development - 1954-04-30 <u>Clifton Record</u></h4>
<p> --Continuation 2 of 2.--</p>

<H3>Ovee Colwick, Early settler On Neils Creek, Leaves Many Heirs
<br>
By Miss Millie Bronstad</h3>

Ovee Colwick (or Kjolvig) which was the original name), was born near Stavanger, Norway, on March 27, 1825. His home was near the sea which abounded in fish; so it is not surprising to find that he became a fisherman by trade as were also his father and his brother.</p>
<p>He was sufficiently successful in the fishing trade to save a modest sum of money and so determined to immigrate to America-that land of liberty, progress, and prosperity.</p>
<p>The subject of this sketch was a self-made man as he spent only a few months in school He was reared and instructed from early boyhood in the Lutheran Church.</p>
<p>On July 7, 1852, he married Johanne Margarete Naadland.</p>
<p>Among the early pioneers of Bosque county we find this sturdy Norseman, Ovee Colwick, who, with his wife, came to America in 1854, settling first in La Salle County, Illinois. In 1859 the family came to Texas and settled on a farm in the Neils creek valley of Bosque county in the Norse community.</p>
<p>Mrs. Colwick's sister, Bergitte Cecelia Naadland, who will be remembered as Mrs. B. C. Martin, accompanied the Colwicks to America.</p>
<p>Their voyage to America was an eventful trip. While at sea a son, Thomas Theodore, was born to the Colwicks. We knew him as T. Theo Colwick, who was a postmaster at Norse.</p>
<p>Kleng Peerson, now growing old and unable to continue the work and shoulder responsibilities of a colonizer gave to Ovee Colwick half of the land which the legislature had granted him as a colonizer. In return for this he was to have a home with the Colwicks and be cared for, and until his death he lived in the Colwick home as one of the family. He died in 1865 and was buried in the Norse Cemetery. On this tract of land received from Peerson the Colwicks built their home and lived there the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>Here they endured the vicissitudes and privations incident to a frontier life, since Texas was as yet almost a wilderness.</p>
<p>Then came the Civil War, and Mr. Colwick answered the call to service. The young mother often felt the weight of her responsibilities, but like most pioneer women she was given the wisdom, strength and fortitude to carry on.</p>
<p>On one occasion three Indian braves rode up to her home, dismounted, walked into the house unannounced, and indicated by signs that they were hungry and wanted food. Though her heart was thumping with fear, she hastily prepared a meal for them which they ate with relish. Imagine the relief when they rose from the table and bowing politely, rode away. The children came out from their hiding places in the kitchen to watch the Indians leave.</p>
<p>Mrs. Colwick, after an extended illness, passed away on March 25, 1881. Four sons and four daughters had come to bless their home. These were T. Theo Colwick; Margaret, Mrs O. M. Olson; Martha, Mrs. C. O. Bronstad; John Naadland Colwick; Sam Houston Colwick; Olivia, Mrs. T. A. Eggen; Alfred Colwick and Jennie, Mrs. S. H. Reesing -all deceased.</p>
<p>On November 3, 1881, Mr. Colwick married Miss Martha Erickson. To this union seven children were born - Emil T.; Millie, Mrs Dude Cox; Magnus L. and Lena, all deceased; Clara, Mrs Alfred Amundson; Lillie, Mrs. August Heck; and Miss Agnes Colwick.</p>
<p>Mr. Colwick was a member of the Masonic Fraternity and an active member of the Farmers Alliance. In cooperation with Squire Ole Olson he originated the Norse Mutual Fire Insurance Association.</p>
<p>He died on July 12, 1895, and was buried in a private cemetery on his farm.</p>
<p>Mr. Colwick was a progressive farmer. By dint of energy and persevering industry, combined with rigid economy, he became financially independent ere many years had passed. He was an accommodating neighbor, a faithful friend, a devoted husband and father and a loyal citizen of his adopted country.</p>


<h3>One Hundred Years With The Rogstad Family In County</h3>
<h3>By Johanna Rogstad</h3>
(Data and other information furnished by various other members of the Rogstad family)</p>
<p>Berger Rogstad was born in Oslo, Norway, November 27, 1820, and died December 9, 1880. His wife, (nee Fureseth), was also born in Norway, November 7, 1821, died January 1, 1903, was buried in the Norse Cemetery, at Our Savior's Lutheran Church, the first Lutheran Church in Bosque County.</p>
<p>These two person were my grandparents and I will hereinafter refer to them as Grandpa and Grandma.</p>
<p>Grandpa Rogstad came from Oslo,Norway; his family was well known in Norway; he had a bachelor brother that was a member of the "Storting" (Norwegian Parliament) in Norway. Several other brothers and sisters -a daughter and one brother - in later years, a Miss Anna Rogstad, was also a member of the "Storting" - at that time the only woman to ever hold this position.</p>
<p>Grandpa first came to Wisconsin but had heard about a Norwegian settlement in Texas down near Brownsboro, East Texas; the settlement is known as "Four Mile"</p>
<p>On his arrival there in 1854 he lived in a boarding house operated by a Mrs. Bronstad, a nice lovely widow lady, who had come to Texas in the early 1850's. Mrs. Bronstad had buried her husband in East Texas and supported herself and five children by operating this boarding house. These children were Ole Bronstad, Karen (Mrs. Ole Wold), Ellen (Mrs Otto Swenson), Christiana (Mrs Adolph Godager), Gina (Mrs. P. H. Hansen). All married Bosque County Scandinavian men by names listed. Karen later moving to Seattle, Washington, and Gina to Mexia, Texas. Ole married Mathilda Canuteson. All the others remained in Bosque County and have a host of descendants.</p>
<p>Shortly after Grandpa arrived in East Texas he heard talk that several families were moving to Bosque County -among them were the Hendrick Dahls and Mrs. Bronstad families. The Dahls came from Norway at the same time the Bronstads came over. Mrs. Dahl, that is Madam Dahl or Grandma Dahl as she was affectionately known by all the Norwegians and others in and around Clifton, was a niece of my Grandma Rogstad.</p>
<p>Grandpa Rogstad was very interested in this charming widow lady. He offered his services to help move her and am sure Grandma needed help with her cattle, household supplies and five children.</p>
<p>This proved to be a rather romantic trip, as they loaded a wagon drawn by two oxens[sic] with household supplies and the five children. Berger and Anne walked most of the way beside the wagon and herding the cattle. This trip took at least ten days -- perhaps two weeks. During this long walk they learned to know much about each other and evidently their thoughts turned to love and romance They were married shortly after their arrival in Bosque County, one of the first if not the first, Norwegian couples to marry in Bosque County, some time in the latter part of 1854.</p>
<p>They lived in a rock blacksmith shop on the Questad place in the Norse community while he followed his trade as a "Rock Mason", a trade he learned in Norway. He helped build many of the old rock houses in the community-some of them are still standing -such as the rock building on the Quested place and an old rock building in Meridian.</p>
<p>November 22, 1855, a son, John (my father), was born to this happy family. Shortly thereafter Grandpa purchased some land on the mountain, now known as the "Rogstad Mountain," where he built a nice little rock home for his family. As the years went by two other sons and two daughters were born to this couple -Thomas (Tom), who later lived with his family on the old home place on the Rogstad Mountain, now occupied by his daughter, Mabel (Mrs. John Bryn), Bernt, Martha, and Pauline.</p>
<p>The Rogstad children and others received their education in a little one-room schoolhouse known as the "Peck School House" located in a pasture -now known as the "Gary Creek Pasture" owned by the John Rogstad family. The Rogstad family is synonymous with Bosque County as this is their Centennial year, too. Many descendants still live in Bosque county and surrounding communities - most of the Lutheran Churches (ELC) in Texas have some descendants of this family.</p>
<p>John lived in the Norse community and married Pauline Hoff, daughter of another family who came from Norway about 12 years later. They had seven children;; four still live in Bosque County -Belle, Perney, Marie (Mrs. H. C. Pederson), and Raymond. Alma (Mrs. N. G. Grimland, the oldest, lists Clifton as her home but spends most of her time with her three children, Maidye (Mrs. Hans Boese), Nashville Tennessee; Major Neal G. Grimland, now at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, who recently served two years in Turkey with the J. A. M. M. A. T.; John Nell (Mrs. Carl Hoefs) in Las Vegas, Nevada. These three children spent most of their youth in and near Bosque County. Bernt, the oldest boy moved to Chickasaw, Oklahoma [illegible] . . . drifted across the border to Wichita Falls, Texas. The writer, Johanna, lives in Dallas - where so many Bosque Countians now live - where we all talk about "down home" so much we have all our friends and especially our Lutheran Church acquaintances using the expression, "down home" as frequently and readily as we do.</p>
<p>Thomas (Tom) had three sons and three daughters. The oldest, Belvin, lives in Bosque county near Cranfills gap, and has three children living in the county as well as other parts of Texas. Alfred lives in Waco, had one daughter,Hattie (Mrs. Walter Shurley), and Mabel (Mrs. John Bryn), has two sons, Edward, living in Clifton, Ray in Midland; she lives near Cranfills Gap. Another son, John, lives in Dallas and has two daughters,Gail and Nancy; and Nora, lives in Washington, D. C.</p>
<p>Martha (Mrs. John Hoff) had two daughters - Agnes (Mrs. Chas. Hoel), lives in the Norse community; Bess (Mrs. Lewis Cunningham), lives n Comanche. Bernt and Pauline, the two youngest children of Grandpa and Grandma, were childless. Bernt lived on a farm near the old home place on the Rogstad Mountain, reared several foster children. Pauline never married. She lived in Dallas</p>
<H3>W. T. Tergerson Relates Troubles in Getting Early Cotton Ginned.</H3>

<p>Given below are two exerpts[sic] concerning early trials of a Norwegian settler in Bosque County west of Clifton which are taken from the thesis of Oris E Pierson of Clifton:</p><br><br>
<p>In the early seventies Solberg's gin was located near the Jens Ringness home, at the Bois d'Arc lane. In 1872 or 1873 W. T. Tergerson yoked up his oxen to the wagon to to to Solberg's gin with his cotton. It was a long way to travel in that day, to go from what is now known as the Mustang Community to the Ringness place. By late afternoon he managed to make the long trek to the gin - quite an event in itself -only to learn that too many farmers were waiting ahead of him that he could not possibly get his bale ginned that day. He was concerned about his family, so he resolved to leave the wagon, loaded with cotton, at Solberg's gin and walk home that night driving the oxen ahead of him. The distance was some nine or ten miles and this was not easily covered by oxen in a short time. Nevertheless, by sheer determination, will power, and perseverance he traversed the distance and in the wee hours of the morning he arrived at his home.</p>
<p>"There was no time for sleep, for he had to return to Solberg's gin as early as possible the next day in order that he might complete his ginning and get home before another night passed. Almost before he was sound asleep he arose and started on his journey again. By noon he arrived at the gin, but he learned to his consternation that during the night the gin burned down and not until about one year should have passed would Solberg be able to rebuild. He must now go to Clifton, another nine miles farther away from home. This he did, and after approximately three days had passed, he returned to his home with single bale of cotton.</p>
<p>"on another occasion Mr. Tergerson took another bale of cotton to Cranfills Gap. The power used by this gin was horse power -real horse power. The horse marched round and round, turning a large cog wheel by means of a long bar to which the traces of the horse were attached. When the lint was separated from the seed, the farmer picked the lint up from the floor, carried it to a huge hopper and packed the bale by "tromping" around. On this particular day the horse which was used for power had had a hard day, and when the time came for Mr. Tergerson to gin his cotton, the horse gave out and there was no power. Tergerson unyoked the oxen from his wagon and hooked them to the power wheel of the gin and in that way furnished power to gin his own cotton while he himself carried and packed and helped bind his own bale..".</p>
<h3>Cranfills Gap Named After George Eaton Cranfill; Came to Bosque [?]
<br>
By Chris L. Rohne, March, 1954</h3>

<p>Compiled and written as a part of the Centennial History of Bosque County, Texas.</p>
<p>Cranfills gap might have well have been named Montevideo, Latin for "I see the mountain," nesting as it does on the eastern slope of a naturally landscaped mountainside. But it more naturally took its name earlier when the town first sprang up a mile west of the present town site in the "Gap" of two mountains, through which the present Hamilton-Bosque County line runs and also through which the old Comanche road meandered. Probably this road was an old horseback trail from Waco to Comanche, marked out as an early mail route, since in the memory of some the relay lap from Waco to Dublin was a day's "run" for the horseback mail carrier. The town of Cranfills gap always has been in Bosque County, but its scope of friendly influence has radiated well into both counties.</p>
<p>Cranfills gap was named after George Eaton Cranfill, who came from Illinois to Texas in 1850. He lived one year at Lancaster, Texas in Dallas County and came here in 1851. He was a descendant of Hezekiah Cranfill who married a Miss Needles, a woman of German Dutch origin, and became a property owner in North Carolina in 1794. George Eaton Cranfill had three sons-Ross, Zacheus (Zach) and Sam. Ross lived between Clifton and Valley Mills, and Zack and Sam live and died here at Cranfills Gap.</p>
<p>Sam, according to a family legend, in his early youth was once a captain of a company of Indian fighters. He had one leg that was slightly lame. This he attributed to the fact that he was once involved in an Indian raid into Bosque County, headed by a Comanche Indian Chief. Several settlers were killed. Finally all the Indians were killed except the chief. It became the duty of Sam Cranfill to capture the chief of the group. The Indians already had been "cut off" from returning to their territory in Somervell County. Sam chased the chief around and around a mountain until the [sic] got to the flat top of the mountain where he killed the chief with his tomahawk. In examining the Indian, he discovered that the race around this peak had shortened the Indian's inside leg as well as his own. since then the mountain has been called "Comanche Peak." (At least, this is a story said to have been told by Sam Cranfill to one of his nephews, Tom Cranfill, at Waco, when the latter was about eight years of age.)</p>
<p>Samuel B. Crawford, father-in-law of Sam B. Cranfill established the Cranfills Gap Post Office on Neils Creek, Hamilton County, in April 18, 1879, with Samuel B. Crawford appointed as postmaster.</p>
<p>The name and location of the post office was changed to Cranfills Gap, Bosque County, on May 21, 1879. The original post office, a substantial stone structure, still stands about two miles north of town on a place now owned by Ingmar Rohne. This was the original S. B. Cranfill Survey. G. H. Giddings was the first mail carrier on Route No 31.549, which was a route from Waco to Hazledell, Texas, dating back to April 18, 1879. The mail was carried six days per week. Sam Cranfill procured the charter for the first Cranfills Gap Post Office in 1879, and the original charter is an heirloom of the family.</p>
<p>From the mother's side of the Cranfills, it may be of passing interest locally to know that the original George Eaton "married a Swedish girl by the name of Catherine Tussa".</p>
<p>Here, too, it may be stated that we are indebted to the deceased Dr. J. B. Cranfill, M. D., LLD. of Dallas, a cousin of Sam Cranfill, for the historical information about Cranfill family from his book compiled for the Cranfill family reunion held at Abilene, Texas, July 3-4 1938. Too, J. B. Cranfill probably became the best known of the Cranfill family. He was a radio preacher, publisher, doctor and lawyer. While he was a country doctor at Turnersville, he started the country newspaper, called the Turnersville Effort, which the following year grew into the Gatesville Advance, a country weekly paper. He founded the Baptist Standard which still is the Baptist denominational paper of Texas, and was the author of five books, all of a deep-seated Christian background. He stated, "I have edited and directly or indirectly published many other books, among them being a 13 volume set with the title "Carroll's Interpretation of the English Bible". In his closing sentences of his little book, "The Cranfill Family," he reiterated a long historic principle, "Let us keep the family escutcheon untarnished."</p>

<h4>1953-09-25</h4>
<p>Nothing can replace a friend -- especially when 18 of them show up to plow your land when you are confined to your bed with an ailing heart. That was the feeling of J. C. Tergerson last Thursday when 18 of his neighbors mounted their tractors and drove over to plow Tergerson's 125 acres of land for him.</p>
<p>These days when everyone seems rushed, one can imagine the type of neighbors Mr. Tergerson has been for his neighbors in the Mustang Community near Cranfills Gap for them to pitch in and help him in this wholehearted manner.</p>

<h4>1957-10-18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obituary Given For <b>Chris Rohne</b>, Civic, Church, Business Leader At Cranfills Gap</h4>
<p>Bosque County lost one of its most prominent and beloved citizens on the levels of local, county, and state affairs last week when <b>Chris L. Rohne</b>, aged 58 years, 5 months, and 12 days, of Cranfills Gap, died in his sleep on Wednesday morning, October 9, at the home of his son-in-law and daughter, Mr. and Mrs. Joe Eidson, in Fort Worth.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Rohne had been in ill health and under a doctor's care for several years, it is understood that during the six months prior to his demise he seemingly had regained his health and again was enjoying life to the fullest extent. The night before his death, after a very pleasant day, Mr. Rohne went to bed in excellent sprites. His wife discovered his death the next morning as the result of a heart attack. . . .</p>
<p>Pallbearers were six of Mr. Rohne's nephews - Allen Bronstad and Walton Bronstad of Fort Worth, Oscar Knudson, of Carlsbad, New Mexico, Maurice Bronstad, of Denton, Wayne Arlen Rohne, of Austin, and Paul Christenson, of Cranfills Gap. . . .</p>
<p>Youngest child of the four sons and five daughters of the late Evan Paulson Rohne and Mrs. Marianne Oleanna Egeberg Rohne, Chris Ludvig Rohne was born on April 28, 1899, in the boggy community between Clifton and Cranfills Gap at the homestead founded by his parents in 1880 and presently occupied by his brother and sister-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. P. B. Rohne.</p>
<p>Mr. Rohne's father died when he was two years of age, and his mother, truly a sturdy pioneer with a stiff back and stout heart was left alone to rear a large family and take care of a farm and business matters. Even as a two-year-old Mr. Rohne's sunny disposition and fun-loving spirit, which won for him so many friends throughout the years, did much to while away lonesome and dark hours for his widowed mother.</p>
<p>Baptized into the Lutheran faith in infancy by the late Reverend J. K. Rystad, Mr. Rohne was confirmed in that faith on July 12, 1914, at the Old Rock Church and remained a faithful, conscientious, and devoted member or the Lutheran Church throughout his lifetime.</p>
<p>Mr. Rohne devoted much time and effort to the affairs of the St. Olaf Lutheran Church at Cranfills gap, where he served as either Sunday School superintendent of teacher for 28 years. He also was president of a number of church auxiliary units and was instrumental in the growth and progress of the St. Olaf Church congregation and its building program. Many memorials to him were given for a piano or organ fund for the new St. Olaf Sunday School building, a fund which was begun following his death. The parsonage fund, which was so near and dear to Mr. Rohne's heart, also was remembered generously.</p>
<p>He was often heard to say, "I hope we soon can build a nice new parsonage for our preacher.: Usually when an idea occurred to Mr. Rohne, he started work toward its realization; and the idea eventually became an accomplished fact. Following his schooling in the Cranfills Gap public Schools, Mr. Rohne attended Clifton College and Luther College at Decorah Iowa.</p>
<p>On June 18, 1921, Mr. Rohne married his childhood sweetheart, Miss <b>Marie Bronstad</b>, a daughter of the late Mr. and Mrs. G. O. Bronstad, prominent residents of Cranfills gap. To their marriage were born three daughters, LoVerne (Mrs. Ray Schibler), Geraldine (Mrs. Joe Eidson), and Marynell (Mrs. Wendell Wallace). Mr. and Mrs. Rohne were devoted to one another and had a close, enviable marriage: he greatly loved and enjoyed his daughters; and his five granddaughters were the price and joy of his life.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1920 Mr. Rohne became affiliated with the First Security State Bank at Cranfills Gap, and three years later he was made cashier of that banking institution, a position which he retained until his retirement because of ill health in 1955. At the time of his retirement Mr. Rohne also was vice president of the bank. He always was mindful that he was a custodian of other people's money, a burden he never took lightly.</p>
<p>During Mr. Rohne's may years of service with the First Security State Bank, he took a very active interest in the civic affairs of his community, his country, and his state, as well as in church activities, as previously mentioned. At one time Mr. Rohne also served as chairman of the Fourth District of the Texas Bankers Association.</p>
<p>In addition to his duties as a banker, Mr. Rohne was active in ranching and conducted a life insurance agency representing among other companies, the Amicable Life Insurance Company of Waco for more than 30 years. His ranching interests stemmed from his desire to sponsor the improvement of the livestock industry in his community and country. Only recently Mr. Rohne also was elected second vice-president of the Bosque Memorial Museum Association. He was proud of his Bosque County heritage and had a great deal of knowledge concerning the county's early history in his community. For many years he also served as Cranfills Gap correspondent to The Clifton Record.</p>
<p>Mr. Rohne had endeared himself to a large number of people throughout the state because of his business and civic activities and had made many lasting friends in the banking profession. A man of kindness, tolerance, and a keen intellect, Mr. Rohne was an able public speaker and had the ability to get things done quickly and well. It always was to <b>Chris Rohne</b> that folks turned when they needed something done at Cranfills Gap, and it also was he whom his friends and neighbors sought when they required advice.</p>
<p>Mr. Rohne liked everyone and every animal, flower, and object of beauty in this world. He carried no grudge toward any man and often said, " I do not want to carry any grudges because I want to go to heaven when I die."</p>
<p>Left to survive Mr. Rohne are his wife, Mrs. <b>Chris L. Rohne</b> of Cranfills Gap: his three daughters, Mrs. Ray Schibler, of Gruver, Mrs. Joe Eidson, of Fort Worth, and Mrs. Wendell Wallace, of Pasadena; his five granddaughters, Marcia Schibler, 7, and Raye Dean Schibler, 3, of Gruver. Marilyn Eidson, 7, of Fort Worth, and Patricia Wallace, 5 and Pamela Wallace 2, of Pasadena; two brothers, Reverend J. Magnus Rohne of Phoenix, Arizona, and P. B. Rohne, of Star Route 2, Clifton; and three sisters, Mrs. G. S. Knudson (Pauline), of Cranfills gap, Mrs. C. T. Jenson (Emma) of Clifton, and Mrs. J. Justin Jenson (Helen), of Baytown.</p>
<p>In addition to his parents, Mr. Rohne was preceded in death by one brother, Oscar Rohne, and by two sisters, Mrs. Minnie Mickelson and Mrs. Cora Christenson.</p>
<p><b>Chris Rohne</b> truly will be missed in Bosque County where his mark was wide and sure, but he left each of us a well-trod path to follow. May we emulate his efforts by furthering Bosque County and our individual communities in business, civic, church, and cultural fields. </p>

<h4>1957-11-29</h4>
<p> Mrs. <b>Chris Rohne</b> and Miss Marguerite Bronstad returned home last week after having been away for two weeks. They visited Mrs. Rohne's daughter, Mrs. Joe Eidson, and family in Fort Worth. Then Mrs. Rohne went to Pasadena for a visit with another daughter, Mrs. Wendell Wallace, and her family while Miss Bronstad went to Holdenville, Oklahoma, to visit the Douglas Hudson family. En route home she also visited the Homer Bronstads in Denton.</p>

<h4>Beloved Citizen of Clifton Gives Report On Early Days Of City's Development - 1954-04-30 <u>Clifton Record</u></h4>
<p> --Continuation 1 of 2.--</p>
<p>His son, Tom Cranfill became president of the Texas Independent Oil Producers Association and amassed a handsome fortune. There were several Tom Cranfills in the family, one of whom probably was the first barber in Cranfills Gap on a part time basis. However it is believed that John Parson probably built the first barbershop.</p>
<p>The original land surveys in and around Cranfills gap are the S. M. Edwards survey out of which the present Town site was carved, the Jacob Thomas, William Hussard, Adam Kuykendall, Jophia St John, W. M. Smith, Robert Dennis, R. P. Boyce Pool. Pollard, Foss, Olson, Renfro, and many other smaller surveys, some of which have in their chain of title, an original patent, a sheepskin parchment containing the words, "In the name of the Republic of Texas," signed by Anson Jones, second president of the Republic of Texas.</p>
<p>The Renfros came here quite early - in the early fifties -when only the "Cranfills and Ringnesses" were here. Creth Renfro and his son, Francis, were killed by the Indians, presumably the Comanches, west of town between here and Lanham. Francis Renfro's horse came back home three days later, with three arrowheads in his saddle, so the family knew they had been murdered. Francis was found later, about seven miles west of town but the father, Creth Renfro, was not found until six months later in the German Valley or possibly the Stanford Valley. He was identified by his pocket knife and a part of his shirt.</p>
<p>Sill Renfro of the same family held three cattle rustlers captive in a log cabin on the Austin Branch on the land now owned by W. E. Dink Henderson. They were tried under the original charter oak, now Pool Park, and sentenced to be hanged. The three were hanged about two miles west of Cranfills gap on the old G. C. Goar place. This we are not able to explain since the Goar place is in Hamilton County - it might have been the place of the crime, or they just had the best trees.</p>
<p>Richard Tindall and Bill Cannon were other early settlers here. Bill Cannon ran a saloon and had a race track on the old Charley N Cranfill place about five miles west of Cranfills Gap before there was any town here. His place got to be "nicknamed" Bittersburg, because of his luxurious sale of Hosteter's Bitters, a medicinal product with exhilarating stimulus. Joe Cox, father of W. H. Cox of the Boggy community, came here about this same time.</p>
<p>Among the early Norwegians who came here were: Jens Jenson (1850), Lars Olson (1848), Salve Knudson, Bersven E. Swenson (1858), Chris Pederson, August Pederson, Lasson Reierson, C. O. Strand, B. M. Foss and many others who settled here soon afterward. B. B. Swenson, son of Bersven E.Swenson (who died here) rode horseback to announce the first Lutheran Church Service which was held on the old Ringness place.</p>
<p>H. M. (Uncle Minor) Gaston came here shortly after the Civil War. His son, Ras Gaston who was 84 years of age on February 10, 1954, proudly states that he has only had one address - Cranfills Gap. It is true that he is older than the post office, but he just waited to get his mail until the Cranfills gap Post Office was established. Mr. Gaston was born on the old Tom Simmons place which is now owned by Mr. Whitaker.</p>
<p>[ one column illegible]</p>
<p>It was first built on the adjoining B. B. Swenson tract but burned and was moved to the new site, but retained its name as the Swenson School House. Branhagen first taught summer Lutheran Bible School there.</p>
<p>Two early scholars who left an indelible impression here were Hugo Erickson, a graduate of the University of Sweden, who specialized in business courses to more mature male students in the old Rohne school House and other Schools in the Neils Creek Valley, and professor A. H. Danby Olson from Denmark, who came about the time G. O. Bronstad opened his store here, and naturally so, since he, too, had clerked in the Miller Store at Morgan with Mr. Bronstad. Both were high type scholars and especially able in mathematics.</p>
<p>The Cranfills gap school system is now a consolidation of the following original school districts: Rohne, Live Oak, Percival, Goar, Meridian Creek, Mustang, Boggy, Harmony, a part of Spring Creek, and Mount View. Mount View was a previous consolidation of Stanford, German Valley, and the Hall School districts. Also previously Boggy and Shell Rock became the same district. The Cranfills Gap School system always has been a credit to Bosque County as well as Hamilton County, in which much of its territory lies. The scholastic standard always has been high, but even now, as this is written, the Cranfills Gap Girls are 1954 district basketball Champions, an honor they have attained on numerous occasions.</p>
<p>In 1913 it was decided to lay out a new orderly town site for Cranfills Gap. The Cranfills Gap Town site and Development Company was organized, headed by W. T. Tergerson as president and O. E. Schow, of Clifton, as secretary. The Temple and Northwestern Railroad had been surveyed to run through Second Street. Associated in the Town site Company were G. O. Bronstad, W. Pitt Barnes, and H. E. Trippett, the latter two of Hico. Mr Trippett acted as attorney for the company.</p>
<p>On June 14, 1913, the sale of the new town site lots was started and was a big day for the New Cranfills Gap. There was a balloon race, with "Little Frank" in one balloon, but the name of the other person is not remembered. Rufus Lackland was the official auctioneer, and the lots told[sic] to the highest bidders. There were people everywhere, and lots sold fast and high, like in a "gold rush." For a while at least, Cranfills gap resembled a boom town. All the buildings were moved the following winter by Chris Aars with a steam engine. The Temple and Northwestern Railroad was not built due to the outbreak of World War I. Soon Cranfills gap simmered down to a normal life and has prospered as a good little town, surrounded by a thrifty farming community, and today maintains its reputation as one of the friendliest little town in Texas.</p>
<p>Of those persons in business in "old town," there is only one here today who is still active in his trade, and that is Bernt Bertelson. He purchased the Frank Spencer barbershop in old town March, 1913, and he still is our efficient barber. Right now he is sort of taking a vacation when everyone is letting his whiskers and mustache grow for the Centennial Celebration, but business should be good later.</p>
<p>In 1927 a fire destroyed the drug store, doctor's office, dentist's office, barbershop, and a grocery store-cleaning the business section to the bank building on main street. All the buildings were rebuilt with nicer structures replacing the old wooden buildings. Cranfills Gap is enjoying a large volume of business today-probably larger than ever before.</p>
<p>Cranfills Gap has had some favorable and outstanding publicity. During a bond drive in World War . . .</p>

<p>. . .the top. Home boys in [?] Wisconsin and Florida heard the news over the radio, early in the morning, the day of the official opening of the bond drive. The news was published in a large number of newspapers over the nation, and Congressman W. R. Poage inserted the bit of news into the Congressional Record for keeps.</p>
<p>Cranfills gap received national and international publicity when Captain Carrol Olson became the first veteran in the United States to secure a Veteran's loan. This news was published in the Stars and Stripes, official army publication and read by many local servicemen on several foreign countries. Captain Olson became eligible for a G. I. Loan before the close of the war, due to his discharge because of a physical disability. "The Ladies Home Journal" sent a special reporter here to get the story and take some pictures, and in the October, 1946, issue published the article, "Meet the Olsons from Cranfills gap, Texas." the story covered several pages.</p>
<p>Morris Ole Huse, still living here, won a $1,000,00 National For tanning contest sponsored by Sears Roebuck & Company, which also included Canada. He and his family [rest illegible]</p>

<h3>Helm Family Moved To Bosque In 1872</h3>
<p>Fielding Helm and his wife, Dorcas Helm, originally of Danville, Kentucky, lost their slaves and most of their property as the result of the Civil War. After trying in vain for several years to recoup their fortune there, they decided to come to Texas and traveled overland in 1871 in covered wagons with a few of their friends.</p>
<p>They settled first in Hill county, but in 1872 they came to the Bosque River Valley to make their home. At that time this beautiful country was virgin soil, which was covered with knee -high grass and beautiful wild flowers.</p>
<p>Coming to Texas with their parents and settling near Clifton were four sons, Willis Sparks Helm, George Benjamin Helm, Isaiah Joseph Helm and William E. Helm and three daughters , Gabriella (later Mrs. J. T. Ford), Mary Eliza (second Mrs. J. T. Ford) and Bettie Helm, who died as a young lady. . . .</p>

<h3>Who was responsible for Norwegian Immigration?</h3>
<p>Given below is more information concerning Norwegian immigration to the United States which was taken from the thesis, "Norwegian settlements in Bosque County, Texas," written by Oris E. Pierson of Clifton, and presented to the faculty of the Graduate school of The University of Texas in Austin.</p>
<p>"The Norwegian immigration to America began in 1825 when the first boatload of Norwegians arrived in New York on the sloop 'Restaurationen.' These immigrants, as is true of almost all migrations, had their advance agents, "Cleng Peerson, who came to America in 1821 to make investigations on the advisability of making Norwegian settlements here, was the person who was chiefly responsible for their coming. The honor of inaugurating Norwegian immigration to America must go to Cleng Peerson. He was the guiding spirit and leader in the whole work of locating, establishing, and expanding this first colony, all settlers originally settling in Kendall County, in western New York It was the same Peerson who pushed westward seeking new and better lands for his countrymen to settle. It was Peerson who went back to Norway, and, by his visits there, promoted new waves of immigration. It was Peerson who found new locations in Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, and in Texas.</p>
<p>"Cleng was born on a farm in Hesthammer, in Tysvaer parish, just north of Stavanger, Norway. Norlie gives the date of his birth as May 17, 1782, and this date is inscribed on his tombstone in the Norse cemetery, Bosque County, Texas. R. B. Andreson also accepts this as the correct date, but more recent researches seem to indicate that the year was 1783. For instance, Blegen, in searching old church records in Norway, learned that Cleng had been confirmed on November 1, 1800, at which time he registered as seventeen and one half years of age. This should make the year of his birth 1873.</p>
<p>"He visited Denmark, Germany, France, and England, and of these travels acquired a wide knowledge of the customs and peoples of these lands, as well as a fairly proficient use of their various languages. He returned to Norway in 1821, and immediately associated himself with the few Quakers then in the country.</p>
<p>"The Quakers or 'Separatists', as they were frequently called, including Peerson, were persecuted. Accordingly, in a meeting in 1821, they selected Cleng Peerson and a companion, Knud Olson Eide, to go to America and investigate all possibilities at their command. For three years Peerson labored and looked and learned in America, and in 1824 he returned to Norway to tell his friends what he had found. The direct result of this visit to Norway was the fitting out and sailing of the first boatload of Norwegian immigrants to America. When the 'Restaurationen' landed in New York in 1825, Peerson was there to meet them.</p>
<p>"He set out on foot, again going west, and in 1833 came to Chicago, then a village of twenty huts in a swampy section. It is said that a half-breed offered Cleng eighty acres of land where Chicago's Loop is now located for a cob pipe and some tobacco and a change of clothing, but that Peerson did not want this swampy, unhealthy portion.</p>
<p>"In 1849 he went to Texas to investigate the possibility of a new settlement in that state. He was so well pleased with what he found that he went north late that year only to return with a company of immigrants to Texas in 1850. He then lived near Dallas, Texas, for four years, and in 1854 he moved to Bosque County, Texas, where he remained until his death, December 16, 1865.</p>
<p>"During the period 1850 to 1854 when he lived with the Ole Canuteson family near Dallas, Peerson had explored much of the Trinity River for over two hundred miles north and south. He was enthusiastic about this section both for farming and stock raising.</p>
<p>"There were only a few people living in what is now Bosque County in 1853, but there were enough men to sign a petition asking the Legislature of the State of Texas to create a new county, Bosque out of what was then the northern part of McLennan County. The legislature acted favorably on the petition, and by an act of the Legislature of the State of Texas, February 3, 1854, Bosque County was created. The state offered free land to those who would go there to settle. This news Peerson received with delight, and he immediately made this information available to his friends in East Texas. This was the spark needed to fire the northmen to a new migration and some of them at once initiated plans to move from Kaufman to Bosque County."</p>
<p>According to a letter from Ole Canuteson to R. B. Anderson in Madison, Wisconsin, written on December 16, 1894, Cleng Peerson moved to Bosque County in 1854, not a a leader at that time but as a follower, as he was too old to undertake leadership any more. The last years of his life were spent in the O. Colwick home. He would of course, go around among his neighbors, where he was always welcome and felt at home.</p>
<p>"A certain Johan Nordbee came from Ringebu in Gudbrandsdal in 1832. This is a province on the eastern coast of Norway, and Nordbee was the first to come from a new section, all others having come from the Stavanger area, one of the southwestern sections of the land. Nordbee first went to Kendall county, New York, where he stayed four years. In 1836 he moved to La Salle County, Illinois, and one year later he again moved, this time to Shelby County, Missouri. He was still not satisfied and we next find him in Texas, near Dallas, where he lived on a 1920-acre farm. He was a physician and while he resided on this farm near Dallas, Texas, he continued to practice medicine. The time of his arrival is not definitely known, It is certain that he was here as early as 1841. He thus became the first Norwegian to occupy Texas as his home, but since he was not interested in making settlements, he made no attempts at founding a colony, not even of trying to influence his native kinsmen to come into his neighborhoods.</p>
<p>"The program of directing the Norwegian immigration to form settlements in the south and southwest was left to one, John Teinert Reierson. In John R. Reierson we meet another advance agent, somewhat comparable to Cleng Peerson. Reierson was one of the most vigorous advocates of emigration in Norway in the forties. He was to keep careful notes on his travels, make careful observations, and at the end of his visits publish his findings. He was more thorough than Peerson, kept a much better set of notes, and the publication of his book exerted a wider influence on emigration than was the case with Peerson.</p>
<p>"In the early spring, 1845, Reierson and a small group set sail for America. When they came to New Orleans in June, they learned of the Congressional resolution of March 1, 1845, providing for the annexation of Texas. At new Orleans one of the party bought a Texas land patent for 1476 acres, whereby he might select any unclaimed land upon which the group wished to settle. When they reached a place for the settlement they called it 'Normandiet,' that is Normandy. This was soon changed to the name of Brownsboro, In addition to those few who arrived at Brownsboro in 1845, approximately fifty more came in 1846, and a handful in 1847. In 1848 Reierson established another settlement, Prairieville, in Kaufman County. Some families moved from Brownsboro to this new settlement, and in 1850 they were reinforced by fourteen families from Norway. This made up just about the total immigration population to Texas direct from Norway, and in 1852 the estimated number was less than one hundred fifty people."</p>

<p>A wedding of interest to their many friends in Bosque county was the marriage of Miss Jurdiss Maris Colwick, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Ennis M. Colwick, of Route 2, Clifton, to Mr. Wayne Arlen Rohne, of Cranfills Gap, at 7:00 o'clock Saturday night, November 7, in the Trinity Lutheran Church in Clifton. Performing the lovely double-ring ceremony was Reverend Walter T. Gigstad, pastor of the Church.  </p>

<h4>1954-01-29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dallas News story On Bosque Norwegian Settlers Ties In With Centennial Year</h4>
<p>In 1833, so the story goes, a dynamic Norwegian named Cleng Peerson was offered the eighty acres where Chicago's Loop in now located in exchange for a pipe, some tobacco and a change of clothing.</p>
<p>Cleng Peerson, who probably hadn't heard of the famed purchase of Manhattan at a similar bargain, scorned the proposition. The land was too swampy, he told the Indian who had approached him.</p>
<p>Twenty years later Peerson found a land more to his liking, It was in the western part of Bosque County. Texas between Clifton and Cranfills Gap.</p>
<p>While this land hasn't attained the value of Chicago's loop, it is an area of magnificent vistas, rolling hills wooded by cedar, live oak, Spanish oak and other trees, and coursed by clear, rippling streams.</p>
<p>Here in the valleys of Neills, Gary, Meridian and Bee Creeks, Texas' largest Norwegian colony came into being in 1854. And this year Bosque county and its large Norwegian community mark their centennials.</p>
<p>Today there are an estimated 475 families of predominantly Norwegian blood still in the area. But the language and old customs are falling into disuse, and many of the people have strayed to other parts of the state and nation.</p>
<p>"The language definitely is going out," says Clifton's Postmaster A. L. Bronstad, member of one of the old families. "However, a few weeks ago the first church service in Norwegian in five of six years was held. The people just took a notion they wanted a service in Norwegian again."</p>
<p>The Evangelical Lutheran church always has been a focal point of Norwegian activities. The mother church, Our Saviour's, is located in the old community of Norse, about midway between Clifton and Cranfills Gap</p>
<p>In the cemetery of Our Savior's is buried Cleng Peerson, who died in [?] and most of the original settlers.</p>
<p>Each November the ladies of the church hold a giant smorgasbord, serving more than 400 persons in the parish all in relays.</p>
<p>Near Our Savior's church is the 100-year-old Questad place, a sturdy rock home in good repair. It was erected by Carl Ingbretsen Questad, a member of one of the first eight Norwegian families to come to Bosque county at the suggestion of Cleng Peerson. A Questad descendant, Mrs. Ole J. Hoel, lives nearby.</p>
<p>Life was often difficult for the early settlers. in particular, they found cotton, a new crop to them, baffling to harvest.</p>
<p>"Some of them tried picking cotton with a parasol in one hand to keep off the hot Texas sun," says Mrs. Hoel. "When this didn't work so well they tried picking on moonlit nights."</p>
<p>The fair-skinned Vikings had not been accustomed to such a sun in their own northern land.</p>
<p>Also baffling to them was the presence in their midst of a learned Swede of noble lineage named Gustaf Wilhelm Belfrage.</p>
<p>While the hard-working Norwegians tilled their fields Belfrage loped about, butterfly net in hand, catching insects. Few of the Norwegians knew that he was one of the great naturalists of America and that his entomological work would be recognized for many generations.</p>
<p>Belfrage, a hardy drinker, had little regard for money. In one night he spent all of a bag of gold rubles he had received from the St Petersburg Museum in Russia for a collection of insects.</p>
<p>But eccentric as he was, the Norwegians tolerated him. He died in 1882 and is buried in the cemetery of Our Savior. The Texas Entomological Society has erected a monument to him there.</p>
<p>The industry of the very first Norwegians is still evident through the Bosque County valleys-in well built stone fences, sturdy farm homes and barns and their churches nearly all dating from the early years.</p>
<p>The history of the Norwegian communities has been set down in scholarly fashion by O. E. Pierson of Clifton, who wrote his thesis for a master degree at The University of Texas on the subject. Person himself is of Norse descent.</p>
<p>He records that the first Norwegian settlements in Texas were at Brownsboro, Henderson county, and Prairieville, Kaufman County, but the settlers were dissatisfied in those places. When Cleng Peerson suggested that they go to an area more like their native Norway, they concluded he was right. Peerson recommended the hill Bosque county country, and that is where they went.</p>
<p>Three community centers flourished for many years- Norse, Normal Hill and Norway Mill.</p>
<p>The stores, blacksmith shops and schools have vanished at all three places. With the coming of good roads, Clifton and Cranfills gap became the centers of trade.</p>
<p>At Norway Mill the old stone mill building still stands. It was erected in 1865 by Ole Canuteson, one of the first settlers. Near it is a large attractive stone house dating from 1867 and now occupied by Oscar Omenson.</p>
<p>The first eight families - the Dahls, two Canutesons, Jensons, Ringnesses, Questads, Rogstads and Piersons, accompanied by a bachelor named Ole Ween -came originally from Hadenmarken, Arendal and Koppervik in Norway. Later immigrants came from the same neighborhoods.</p>
<p>In the 1880's the Norwegians established a community that flourishes today. It is the Norse Gjensidige brandforsikringselskab - the Norse Mutual Fire insurance Company.</p>
<p>Just as the Viking settlers were deeply religious, so were they interested in education. Their schools have followed the general pattern of education in Texas, with English as the language employed. In 1896 a Lutheran high school was organized in Clifton that eventually became Clifton College, a junior college of the first rank.</p>
<p>While there are no fjords or lofty mountains in Bosque county, the Norwegians have loved their adopted, land-locked acres in Texas. They feel they have fulfilled to a degree the work started in 1000 A. D. when Leif Ericson found the New World.</p>
<p>"Some of the early years were hard ones," says Postmaster Bronstad of Clifton, "but our people came here to stay" </p>

<!--<h4>Clifton Record, 1941-05-02</h4> 

<p>Cranfills  Gap suffered the most serious fire loss in the business district this past week and has retarded the forward movement of this town for some time to come. A blaze of undetermined origin at about 10 o&rsquo;clock Tuesday evening, April 22, put the Anderson Food Store out of commission.  </p> 
<p>   Mr. Anderson has almost suffered a nervous breakdown, but he is a man of much courage and will soon be about some kind of business, but he is undecided yet what he will do. The building was owned by Mr. Otto Reesing but Mr. Anderson had been operating a successful food store there for a little more than a year.</p> 
<p>   The devastating fire in the store apparently started in the back of the building but soon spread to the front of the one-story structure. Help was called from Meridian and the fire fighters did a mighty fine job in extinguishing the fire in record time, and in saving the Helm Grocery, Wiley&rsquo;s café and Grimland&rsquo;s hardware store. The stillness of the night was a great help in stopping the rampage of the fire. Building and contents were partly covered by insurance.</p>

<h3>NON-WAR WORKERS PARASITES SAYS F.R. MUST LEAVE CAPITAL  </h3>
<p>WASHINGTON, Jan. 30.--President Roosevelt used blunt language Friday in warning individuals he described as parasites, persons living here only for social reasons, to move out of the national capital to make room for war workers who are arriving at the rate of 1,000 a week.<p>

<p>The press conference statement may or may not have sent shivers down the spines of socialites who can claim no war connection. But one thing was certain--it did bring relief to thousands of long-time natives who read morning headlines that they may be forced to leave the city if not engaged in essential wartime activities. . .</p>
