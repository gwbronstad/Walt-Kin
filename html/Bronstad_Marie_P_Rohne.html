<h4>1933-01-20 </h4>
<h4>THUGS MAKE DAYLIGHT RAID ON THE CRANFILLS GAP BANK </h4>
<p>Two bandits looted the First Security state Bank at Cranfills Gap, 20 miles west of Clifton at noon Tuesday and escaped with $700, leaving Cashier Chris Rohne locked in the vault, whence they had forced him to get the money.</p>
<p>Mr. Rohne was out of the vault in three minutes, he said, but the bandits had escaped, driving west in an automobile and then turning south on the other side of the hill on which Cranfills gap is located. The south road connects with highway seven, and Rohne thought the men either drove to Brownwood or east to Waco, and he telephoned officers at these points.</p>
<p>
Mr. Rohne had just come in to open the bank after the lunch hour when he saw the two men standing on the sidewalk outside. He was suspicious of them and would not open the door. They then walked down the street to a drug store, which they entered and Rohne opened the door. He was alone in the bank.</p>
<p>
A few minutes later the two suddenly walked in, produced pistols and ordered the cashier to "stick- 'em up," which he did. They make him lie on the floor while they searched the teller's cage. Finding no money, they forced Rohne to get up and open the vault and the safe, but they overlooked more money than they took, Mr. Rohne said. The smaller of the two men seemed nervous and the robbery was hurriedly excited.</p>
<p>
The Cranfills Gap bank was robbed three years ago this March by burglars who burned trough the walls and the vault with a gas torch, and last week an unsuccessful attempt was made to break into the safe, the robbers knocking off the knobs, but failing to gain entrance.</p>
<p>
When Mr. Rohne first saw the two men and became suspicious of them he particularly noted their appearance and the appearance of the car. He described the automobile as being a gray Ford sedan, four doors, no rear number plates, the spare tire on the rear worn threadbare, both fenders dented.</p>
<p>The man who first produced a pistol and ordered him to put up his hands was described by Mr. Rohne as six feet tall, weight about 150 pounds, slender, dark, dressed in dark clothes, with a light hat. The other was five feet, 10 inches tall, weight 160, sandy-haired, dressed in khaki jacket and light blue work pants. The man was nervous.</p>
<p>S. C. Feiszell, the Wacoan whose automobile, stolen from him Monday night, was used by the two bandits who robbed the Cranfills Gap Bank, had his property back Wednesday night, but officers were apparently no nearer to the apprehension of the bandits. The stolen car was recovered near Gatesville by Sheriff W. W. Hollingsworth of Coryell County. The use of a Waco car was first suspected when Bosque county officers found a Waco High School tire cover in the brush near Cranfills Gap, where the Feiszell car and a blue sedan had been seen before the robbery. The officers believe the blue car was used for the latter part of the get-away trip. </p>
