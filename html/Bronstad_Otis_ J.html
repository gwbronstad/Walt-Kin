<h3>CHRISTIAN O. BRONSTAD</h3>
<p> Mr. Christian O. Bronstad was born at Romedal, Hedemarken, Norway, August 20th, 1853. His parents were Ole and Christine Bronstad. He attended the school of his native parish and having received the necessary instruction in the Word of God he was confirmed in this baptismal covenant.</p>
<p>€œDuring his teens, Christian heard glowing tales of America, the land of opportunity, of prosperity and freedom and of the bright things awaiting a young man there. Thus this young man’s mind was soon settled oncoming to America. So when Mr. Hendrick Dahl visited back in Norway after having been in America, young Christian fell in line with many others, with Mr. Dahl as escort bid his native land, his friends and all his relatives a fond farewell and turned toward America to seek his fortune. The party on leaving Norway set Bosque County, Texas, as their destination. In the first part of November, 1872, Christian Bronstad, the young emigrant, left Norway. In Bordeaux, France the party was held up three days. In Liverpool another delay, this time of eleven days, held them up. From Liverpool the ship Louisiana of the State Line was boarded. About a month was spent on the Atlantic, and for three days all passengers were shut up on account of the storms. Finally in December 19, 1872 this immigrant at the age of 18, arrived in Waco, Texas.: So reads part of the biography read at the Golden Wedding of Mr. And Mrs. Christian O. Bronstad on March 1, 1927.</p>
<p>Mr. Bronstad was employed about two years in the saw mills and flour mills in Valley Mills. Then he took up his duties at the mill at Norway Mills on Neill’s Creek. Meantime his brother, Gulbrand, had joined him; his parents and others of the family coming to America still later.</p>
<p>On march 1, 1877, Mr. Bronstad was united in marriage to Martha Colwick. It was a double wedding the other couple being Dr. O. M. Olson and Margaret Colwick. The Rev. Ole Estren performed the ceremony.</p>
<p>For about two and a half years after this double wedding the ;young miller and his bride lived at Norway Mills. Leaving the ;mill they lived for a short while on the Colwick farm. In January, 1881, they moved to a newly acquired farm in the Harmony community. Mr. Bronstad was a faithful ;member of Our savior’s Lutheran Church of Norse for nearly fifty years. He was a community worker; worked for better schools, better roads, and has been active in promoting and supporting Clifton College.</p>
<p>Then years ago Mr. And Mrs. Bronstad moved to Clifton where they have resided since. On March 1, 1927 occurred the Golden Wedding of Mr. And Mrs. Christian O. Bronstad and Dr. and Mrs O. M. Olson and the Silver Wedding of Mr. And Mrs. C. A. Brown. Multitudes of friends and neighbors from Clifton and the entire community came to rejoice and bring their friendly greetings to the honored couples in the Bronstad home where the Golden Wedding was held.</p>
<p>A family of twelve__five girls and seven boys, and one grandson have been reared buy Mr. and Mrs. C. O. Bronstad. We can well understand what a source of joy it must have been to Mr. And Mrs. C. O. Bronstad on that memorable occasion of their Golden Wedding to have all their children with them and receive their testimony of love and esteem.</p>
<p>Mr. Bronstad was a faithful member of the Trinity Lutheran Church since his moving to Clifton. He was seen in his usual place at church both at the morning and night services the last Sunday he lived.</p>
<p>That necessary institution in every Christian home: the family altar or family devotion, was kept up by him. Much comfort, guidance and strength was no doubt received in this way during his life. â€œLet the World of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom.: Family devotion anchors the soul, so that it will not very readily drift from God. It draws down upon the domestic circle the blessing of God. We have the assurance that where two or three are gathered in Christ’s name, He will be with them.</p>
<p>Mr. Bronstad understood for some time that the remaining years allotted to him were most likely to be few. But the thought of departing from this life did not annoy or perplex him. He had peace with god. â€œJustified by faith, we have peace with God through our lord Jesus Christ. that was his comfort.</p>
<p>Death came at 10:30, Saturday night, January 20th. Thus, one of God’s noblemen had finished his course,</p>
<p>His passing is a loss to the community. In his friendly and Christian way he wielded a great influence for good. Men who stand like he did on the side of the right and good, who support those institutions which make for true happiness, they are the leaven on society.</p>
<p>Men who can be trusted and relied upon, and who walk among us as examples of civic and Christian virtues, they exalt righteousness, and are an honor to their community.</p>
<p>For him who has passed from our midst, to die was gain,that is our Christian hope.</p>
<p>Funeral services were conducted at the home and at the Trinity Lutheran Church on Monday afternoon at 1:30 with interment in the Trinity Lutheran cemetery, Clifton, Rev. O. T. Boe assisted by Rev. P. E. Thorson and Prof. C. Tyssen, who spoke on behalf of Clifton College, officiated. . . .</p>
<p>He leaves to mourn his departure his wife and the following children: Mrs. C. A. Brown, Miss Millie Bronstad, C.G. Bronstad, J. M. Bronstad, A. L. Bronstad and Mrs. J. M. Huse, all of Clifton; O. K. Bronstad of Fort Worth; M. T. Bronstad of Denison; C. S. Bronstad of Caddo; Mrs. Frank E. Smith of Waco; O. A. Bronstad of Coolidge; and the grandson, Leroy e. Bronstad of Ft. Worth. A daughter, Miss May Bronstad, preceded him in death on August 23, 1930. He also leaves the following sisters and brothers: Mes. Andrea Nelson, Miss Syverine Bronstad, Miss Carrie Bronstad, and Otto Bronstad, all of Waco; G. O. Bronstad of Cranfills gap; Mrs. Pernilla Anderson of near Clifton. Also 17 grandchildren and 5 great grandchildren. He also leaves a large number of other kin and a large circle of friends.</p>
