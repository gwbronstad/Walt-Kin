Immediately after the ceremony the crowd returned to the home of the bride where a reception awaited them. The groom is the son of Mr. and Mrs. G. O.

<p> </p>


<h4>1916-07-14</h4>
<p>It was thought best to take Mrs. J. E. Rucker, who was operated on last week to Waco and Wednesday evening Otis. Bronstad hitched up to his Chevrolet and took her down. At last report she was getting along nicely. . . . </p>

<h4>1916-11-10</h4>
<p>Last Friday the editor of this sheet bummed a ride to Meridian. Otis. Bronstad and N. M. Murphree were out collecting and we got a hunch that they would visit the county capitol and we went along. They went over some roads that did not look like they had ever been trod by a Tin Henry, but it got there all the same. After a few hours spent in Meridian we hit out for Clifton and traveled that scenic highway which looks kinder wobbly to a man who as been used to walking over the public roads that lead into the Gap. One blowout which took eight minutes to fix was the only trouble on the trip. One thing noticeable was the number of new houses, barns and silos. Some grain along the route was up and looking nice. . . .</p>

<p>Monday N. E. Nelson moved into his house formerly occupied as a business house. This started something. Albert Giese moved into the house vacated by Nelson, Jno. Elliott and Robert Bass moved into the house vacated by Giese and Ole Anderson moved into the house vacated by Elliott and Bass. Tuesday Mrs. Lawler and children moved into the house vacated by Simmons last week.</p>

<p>John Huse and Otis Bronstad bought a Chevrolet car from John L. Spurlin. </p>

<h3>CHRISTIAN O. BRONSTAD</h3>
<p> Mr. Christian O. Bronstad was born at Romedal, Hedemarken, Norway, August 20th, 1853. His parents were Ole and Christine Bronstad. He attended the school of his native parish and having received the necessary instruction in the Word of God he was confirmed in this baptismal covenant.</p>
<p>€œDuring his teens, Christian heard glowing tales of America, the land of opportunity, of prosperity and freedom and of the bright things awaiting a young man there. Thus this young man’s mind was soon settled oncoming to America. So when Mr. Hendrick Dahl visited back in Norway after having been in America, young Christian fell in line with many others, with Mr. Dahl as escort bid his native land, his friends and all his relatives a fond farewell and turned toward America to seek his fortune. The party on leaving Norway set Bosque County, Texas, as their destination. In the first part of November, 1872, Christian Bronstad, the young emigrant, left Norway. In Bordeaux, France the party was held up three days. In Liverpool another delay, this time of eleven days, held them up. From Liverpool the ship Louisiana of the State Line was boarded. About a month was spent on the Atlantic, and for three days all passengers were shut up on account of the storms. Finally in December 19, 1872 this immigrant at the age of 18, arrived in Waco, Texas.: So reads part of the biography read at the Golden Wedding of Mr. And Mrs. Christian O. Bronstad on March 1, 1927.</p>
<p>Mr. Bronstad was employed about two years in the saw mills and flour mills in Valley Mills. Then he took up his duties at the mill at Norway Mills on Neill’s Creek. Meantime his brother, Gulbrand, had joined him; his parents and others of the family coming to America still later.</p>
<p>On march 1, 1877, Mr. Bronstad was united in marriage to Martha Colwick. It was a double wedding the other couple being Dr. O. M. Olson and Margaret Colwick. The Rev. Ole Estren performed the ceremony.</p>
<p>For about two and a half years after this double wedding the ;young miller and his bride lived at Norway Mills. Leaving the ;mill they lived for a short while on the Colwick farm. In January, 1881, they moved to a newly acquired farm in the Harmony community. Mr. Bronstad was a faithful ;member of Our savior’s Lutheran Church of Norse for nearly fifty years. He was a community worker; worked for better schools, better roads, and has been active in promoting and supporting Clifton College.</p>
<p>Then years ago Mr. And Mrs. Bronstad moved to Clifton where they have resided since. On March 1, 1927 occurred the Golden Wedding of Mr. And Mrs. Christian O. Bronstad and Dr. and Mrs O. M. Olson and the Silver Wedding of Mr. And Mrs. C. A. Brown. Multitudes of friends and neighbors from Clifton and the entire community came to rejoice and bring their friendly greetings to the honored couples in the Bronstad home where the Golden Wedding was held.</p>
<p>A family of twelve__five girls and seven boys, and one grandson have been reared buy Mr. and Mrs. C. O. Bronstad. We can well understand what a source of joy it must have been to Mr. And Mrs. C. O. Bronstad on that memorable occasion of their Golden Wedding to have all their children with them and receive their testimony of love and esteem.</p>
<p>Mr. Bronstad was a faithful member of the Trinity Lutheran Church since his moving to Clifton. He was seen in his usual place at church both at the morning and night services the last Sunday he lived.</p>
<p>That necessary institution in every Christian home: the family altar or family devotion, was kept up by him. Much comfort, guidance and strength was no doubt received in this way during his life. â€œLet the World of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom.: Family devotion anchors the soul, so that it will not very readily drift from God. It draws down upon the domestic circle the blessing of God. We have the assurance that where two or three are gathered in Christ’s name, He will be with them.</p>
<p>Mr. Bronstad understood for some time that the remaining years allotted to him were most likely to be few. But the thought of departing from this life did not annoy or perplex him. He had peace with god. â€œJustified by faith, we have peace with God through our lord Jesus Christ. that was his comfort.</p>
<p>Death came at 10:30, Saturday night, January 20th. Thus, one of God’s noblemen had finished his course,</p>
<p>His passing is a loss to the community. In his friendly and Christian way he wielded a great influence for good. Men who stand like he did on the side of the right and good, who support those institutions which make for true happiness, they are the leaven on society.</p>
<p>Men who can be trusted and relied upon, and who walk among us as examples of civic and Christian virtues, they exalt righteousness, and are an honor to their community.</p>
<p>For him who has passed from our midst, to die was gain,that is our Christian hope.</p>
<p>Funeral services were conducted at the home and at the Trinity Lutheran Church on Monday afternoon at 1:30 with interment in the Trinity Lutheran cemetery, Clifton, Rev. O. T. Boe assisted by Rev. P. E. Thorson and Prof. C. Tyssen, who spoke on behalf of Clifton College, officiated. . . .</p>
<p>He leaves to mourn his departure his wife and the following children: Mrs. C. A. Brown, Miss Millie Bronstad, C.G. Bronstad, J. M. Bronstad, A. L. Bronstad and Mrs. J. M. Huse, all of Clifton; O. K. Bronstad of Fort Worth; M. T. Bronstad of Denison; C. S. Bronstad of Caddo; Mrs. Frank E. Smith of Waco; O. A. Bronstad of Coolidge; and the grandson, Leroy e. Bronstad of Ft. Worth.

Andrea Nelson, Miss Syverine Bronstad, Miss Carrie Bronstad, and Otto Bronstad, all of Waco; G. O. Bronstad of Cranfills gap; Mrs. Pernilla Anderson of near Clifton.

<h4>Cpl. G. O. Bronstad Writes on Arab Customs in North Africa</h4>
<p> Relatives in Clifton have received the following letter from Cpl G. O. Bronstad, stationed somewhere in North Africa, and parts of it are reprinted below:</p>
<P>"Some time ago on my afternoon off while roaming around I ran into some Arabs threshing wheat which was very interesting to me as I had heard about it many times but never had the opportunity to see it. Wheat is one of the main crops here although they do not raise a great deal but what I have seen has been fairly good grade. From the best information I can obtain it seems as they made between 30 to 40 bushels to the acre which is about an average year. In many of the larger places here they have reapers of the same make as we have in the States. The threshing I was was done by hand. The Arabs would first cut the wheat by hand and then pile it into large stacks to dry for a few days. There is not much danger of rain since it hardly ever rains here at this time of the year. After it has dried thoroughly they take three horses and walk them around in the pile for about five or ten minutes. Then several Arabs walk into the pile and gather up the straw and let the wind blow through it a few times and then piled all the straw into another stack. They go through this procedure three times and Arabs with sacks or a reasonable facsimile gather this wheat from the ground what what I mean they really get every grain. The straw is then carried home for feeding purposes. You probably think the wheat is dirty after picking it from the ground, well it is, but they are not through with it. The way I have seen them clean it is on the same order as we sift sand but they do get it comparatively clean considering the way they have to clean it. Now the larger farms have reapers as I have mentioned before and how they use them on some of these wheat fields along the hill side is beyond me. Labor is very cheap over here, that is Arabs, as they can be hired for only a few francs a day. A franc is equivalent to two cents.</p>
<P>I also ran across some Arabs shelling corn. This consists of several Arabs around a large pile of corn shucking it by hand. It is then carried over to a place where two Arabs are taking their turns with the crank on the hand sheller which is American made. Now I am sure they have some modern corn shellers here some place as there is plenty of American machinery here including tractors and such.</p>
<P>Last week on my day off, I again journeyed out and attempted to visit the flour mill but didn't have any luck as usual. I did get to see their Bran which is a very poor grade of feed. Their best grade of flour is very coarse but fairly white considering everything. I did look in on the Roll floor and above each roll stand they have a large glass cylinder which the flour runs through before it hits the rolls. Don't know just how many stands they have but it looked like quite a few. I still have hopes of going through it one of these days. On my way back I came across what looked like a large market square which consisted of mostly wheat along with some Corn, Oats, Barley and different kinds of beans. Most of the grain was very clean as it had either been hand picked or cleaned with a hand machine. I saw several Arabs (mostly women) cleaning the wheat by hand moving each grain and picking out the rocks and trash. Very slow cleaning but I suppose they have plenty of time. Some of the wheat, I believe I would be safe in saying, was at least half inch long and seemed to be very heavy. This wheat is very hard and looks very much like what we call Spring Wheat. The corn is a yellow corn but it is small and practically round</p>
<P>We have had a couple of swell feeds lately. Last night we had fried chicken, potato salad, cream corn, vegetable salad, pineapple cream pie and beer or iced tea. They are really truing their best to keep us from going hungry and doing a very good job of it."</p>

<h4>Clifton Record, 1941-05-02</h4> 
<p>Cranfills  Gap suffered the most serious fire loss in the business district this past week and has retarded the forward movement of this town for some time to come. A blaze of undetermined origin at about 10 o&rsquo;clock Tuesday evening, April 22, put the Anderson Food Store out of commission.  </p> 
<p>Mr. Anderson has almost suffered a nervous breakdown, but he is a man of much courage and will soon be about some kind of business, but he is undecided yet what he will do. The building was owned by Mr. Otto Reesing but Mr. Anderson had been operating a successful food store there for a little more than a year.</p> 
<p>The devastating fire in the store apparently started in the back of the building but soon spread to the front of the one-story structure. Help was called from Meridian and the fire fighters did a mighty fine job in extinguishing the fire in record time, and in saving the Helm Grocery, Wiley&rsquo;s café and Grimland&rsquo;s hardware store. The stillness of the night was a great help in stopping the rampage of the fire. Building and contents were partly covered by insurance.</p>

<h3>NON-WAR WORKERS PARASITES SAYS F.R. MUST LEAVE CAPITAL  </h3>
<p>WASHINGTON, Jan. 30.--President Roosevelt used blunt language Friday in warning individuals he described as parasites, persons living here only for social reasons, to move out of the national capital to make room for war workers who are arriving at the rate of 1,000 a week.</p>

<p>The press conference statement may or may not have sent shivers down the spines of socialites who can claim no war connection. But one thing was certain--it did bring relief to thousands of long-time natives who read morning headlines that they may be forced to leave the city if not engaged in essential wartime activities. . .</p>

<h4>Poage Deplores Yankee Interference With Racial Problems Of The South </h4>
<p>The Special Committee which was appointed to investigate guayule as a source of domestic rubber spent the Easter Recess visiting the areas where this shrub grows-Southwest Texas and California. Ia am Chairman of the committee. We are all convinced that if necessary the United States could grow all the rubber we need from guayule. We do not know, however whether it can be produced cheaply enough to compete with "tree rubber" and synthetic rubber. . . .</p>

<p>While I did not have an opportunity at Easter to visit at home as many members did, and as I should have liked to do, I am sure that our people are disturbed over the action of the Supreme Court in holding that the Democratic Party cannot decide for itself whom it will admit to its primaries. I think each party should have the absolute right to exclude any person it wants to for any reason that seems good to the party. Of course, I cannot approve of the continued interference with our racial problem by Yankee reformers, whether the be Supreme Court Judges, C. I. O. agitators, or the President's wife. I think that since the negro was first brought to our shores by Yankee slave traders that the Southern people have done a very good job of handling the race problem. I think we are doing a much better Job of it today than the big northern cities are doing. I think that the present interference with Southern social problems can only result in tragedy and grief, particularly for the negro, and this is true even though the fault lies primarily with the Northern agitators and not with our southern Negroes. If these people would only tend to their own business and let us tend to ours we would get along with the negro to the best interest of both races . . . </p>
<blockquote class="gwb">Pogue seems comfortable explaining the bigotry most of his constituents felt. Clearly if Negroes were admitted to the Democratic party, they might gain a political voice and become harder to control.
<br><br>
To the conformist, complacent mind, it is all the fault of the Northern agitators, but note the thuggish implication that social discord . . "can only result in tragedy and grief, particularly for the negro". As the brutal beating of Shillady 25 years prior in Waco, shows, these whites–in–power were ready to become thugs even if it meant laundering the blood stains from grandfather's white sheets.
<br><br>
Many must anticipate a reprise of the heightened interracial tensions post WW I. Hundreds of thousands of able Afro-Americans learned how to fire an M-1, learned hand-to-hand combat. After risking their lives for their county, how many would be content to resume the back-seat, secondary services, second–class citizenship?
<br><br>
The segregationist drone of the 50's and 60's was "States Rights!" How little I realized the right the states wanted was the right to suppress a class of the state's citizenry. This became clear to me when the issue of states rights surfaces again when the complacent comfortable want to suppress lesbians, gays, bi–sexual and trans–gendered people under the banner of Defense of Marriage.
<br><br>
One could ask, "Who fought the economic structure that brought both Mother and Father to the assembly line?"
