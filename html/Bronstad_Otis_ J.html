<p>Miss Selina Tergerson is attending college at Denton. . . . </p>
<h4>1914-09-11</h4>
<p>Last Sunday evening Mrs. A. C. Grimland and little son Paul went over to Womack to spend a few hours at the home of Dr. T. C. Coston. They were accompanied by G. O. Bronstad and Jim Knight. </p>
<h4>1914-10-02</h4>
<p>N. M. Murphree, Gunder Larson, and <b>Otis Bronstad</b> went down to Clifton Thursday on business. </p>

<h4>1914-11-13, Cranfills Gap News [Bronstad Tergerson Wedding]</h4>
<p>Last Sunday evening at 5 o‘clock at the St. Olaf Church Rev. H. W. Estrem pronounced the words that made <b>Otis J. Bronstad</b> and Miss <b>Selma Tergerson</b> husband and wife in the presence of large party of relatives and friends. Immediately after the ceremony the crowd returned to the home of the bride where a reception awaited them. The groom is the son of Mr. and Mrs. G. O. Bronstad and has been a citizen of this town all his life. The bride is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. W. T. Tergerson of this city and was raised in the Mustang community. Both are well known and have the respect and esteem of all who know them. . . .  </p>
<h4>1914-11-20</h4>
<p>W. T. Tergerson, wife and daughter, Miss Alma, <b>Otis Bronstad</b> and lady, A. C. Grimland, and wife, H. F. Hanson, wife and little daughter, Jewel, Gunder and Ole Larson, Misses Mary Larson, Mary (sic) and Loraine Bronstad and Hannah Enger were Cotton Palace visitors the first of the week. </p>
<hr>
<h4>1915-05-28</h4>
<p> W. T. Tergerson, wife and daughter, Miss Alma, went up to Hico Tuesday. They were accompanied by Martin Bertelson and family, H. F. Hanson and family, Gunder Larson and family and Mr. and Mrs. <b>Otis Bronstad</b>. </p>
<h4>1915-07-09</h4>
<p> Last Friday night Mr. and Mrs. Bernt Bertelson, and Mr. and Mrs. <b>Otis Bronstad</b> chaperoned the following young ladies and gentlemen on a picnic excursion to the tournament crossing on Meridian creek: Misses Christine Bertelson, Edna Holiday, Selma Tergerson, Elsie Grimland, Emma Olson, Emma Pederson Minnie Ross and Helen Burreson, Messers Levi Swenson, Rufus Cox and Lawrence Orbeck. . . .</p>
<h4>1915-08-16</h4>
<p>Work on <b>Otis Bronstad</b>'s house is being pushed right along. </p>
<hr>
<h4>1916-02-11</h4>
<p><b>Otis Bronstad</b> circulated a paper Saturday requesting the business men to close up one day or two days if necessary to help work on the Neills Creek road. Everybody signed it and when they get ready down there you‘ll hear of something happening. . .  </p>

<h4>1916-07-14</h4>
<p>It was thought best to take Mrs. J. E. Rucker, who was operated on last week to Waco and Wednesday evening <b>Otis Bronstad</b> hitched up to his Chevrolet and took her down. At last report she was getting along nicely. . . . </p>

<h4>1916-11-10</h4>
<p>Last Friday the editor of this sheet bummed a ride to Meridian. <b>Otis Bronstad</b> and N. M. Murphree were out collecting and we got a hunch that they would visit the county capitol and we went along. They went over some roads that did not look like they had ever been trod by a Tin Henry, but it got there all the same. After a few hours spent in Meridian we hit out for Clifton and traveled that scenic highway which looks kinder wobbly to a man who as been used to walking over the public roads that lead into the Gap. One blowout which took eight minutes to fix was the only trouble on the trip. One thing noticeable was the number of new houses, barns and silos. Some grain along the route was up and looking nice. . . .</p>

<p>Monday N. E. Nelson moved into his house formerly occupied as a business house. This started something. Albert Giese moved into the house vacated by Nelson, Jno. Elliott and Robert Bass moved into the house vacated by Giese and Ole Anderson moved into the house vacated by Elliott and Bass. Tuesday Mrs. Lawler and children moved into the house vacated by Simmons last week.</p>

<p>John Huse and <b>Otis Bronstad</b> bought a Chevrolet car from John L. Spurlin. </p>

<hr>
<h4>1918-02-15</h4>
<p>Monday morning our citizens were surprised to learn that G. O. Bronstad, one of our leading merchants had gone to Waco for an operation for hemorrhage, which was caused by the fall he received some time ago. He was accompanied by his wife and son, <b>Otis</b>, and the doctor. Mrs. Bronstad remained and the others returned home. He stood the operation all right and all of us hope to see him at his place of business soon. </p>
<hr>
<h4>1919-03-21</h4>
<p> Saturday morning about 10 o‘clock fire was discovered in the cream testing room of the Bronstad store. As soon as discovery was made, <b>Otis Bronstad</b> grabbed their fire extinguisher and went squirting a compound on it that smelled like the infernal regions but it checked the fire. When Otis got through A.C. Grimland arrived with another and proceeded to do some extinguishing. By this time the boys had the hose ready to play on the fire if it undertook to pull off any more stunts. Clarence Brown got his hand slightly burned while removing the oil stove which was the cause of the fire. We have not learned the amount of damage but it will not amount to much.</p>

<h4>1921-08-26     KNIGHTS OF THE KU KLUX PARADE AT HILLSBORO</h4>
<p>Hillsboro, Texas, August 20 From the dark precincts of a suburban grave yard a long line of white clad Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, following a flaming torch, emerged here tonight and solemnly paraded through the streets, while hundreds of people stood at attention along the sidewalks.</p>

<p>After circling the downtown streets, the procession returned to the graveyard and dispersed. There was(sic) 105 knights in the line with the leader carrying the torch and others carrying banners of warning to evil doers. [my George Bush-inspired italics] As the procession passed a downtown corner, a notice outlining the object of the local Klan was tacked on a post. No one interrupted the march. A few curious stragglers followed the marchers to the graveyard, but did not dare to approach too near.</p>

<p>This is the first demonstration the Knights of Ku Klux Klan have given here. </p>


<h4>1921-10-07     SHERIFF AND EIGHT OTHER MEN WOUNDED AT LORENA </h4>
<p>Waco, Texas, Oct. 4<sup>th</sup>. Early this morning, at the sanitarium where Sheriff Buchanan was taken when he arrived here, it was stated that he was to be operated on; that his condition was serious and that he might not survive.</p>
<p>Sheriff Bob Buchanan and Louis Crow of Waco, Carl West of Lorena and Will Lawson were seriously wounded Saturday night at Lorena, thirteen miles south of Waco, while a Ku Klux Klan parade was in progress. Buchanan is wounded under the right arm and Crow is stabbed in the right breast. West is shot in the neck. Five other men were more or less seriously hurt.</p>
<p>Those known to have been wounded in the fight are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sheriff Bob Buchanan of McLennan County, bullet wounds in the right side and above the right knee.</li>
<li>Louis Crow of Waco, proprietor of a local laundry, knife wound in the right side.</li>
<li>Carl West, Lorena, bullet wound in the neck.</li>
<li>Will Lawson, Lorena, knife wounds.</li>
<li>Ed Johnson, Waco, knife wound.</li>
<li>Julian Miner, Waco, knife wound.</li>
<li>Will Austin, Lorena, knife wound.</li>
<li>Charlie Westbrook, Lorena, knife wound.</li>
<li>L. S. Dumas, Waco, bullet wound.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sheriff Buchanan, with Deputies I. Mack Wood and M. Burton, reached Lorena Saturday evening, it having been announced that he parade would begin at 8:30 o&apos;clock. The Sheriff soon after arriving in Lorena, notified those who seemed to have charge of arrangements for the parade that the procession could not take place.</p>
<p>It was thought at first that the parade would be called off and the shooting did not begin until an hour and a half after the hour announced. About fifty white robed figures had passed down the main street, then someone began shooting, followed by a fusillade of shots. When the smoke cleared away nine men, including Sheriff Buchanan, Messrs, Crow and West were found to be wounded.</p>
<p>Ambulances were sent from Waco to Lorena and the wounded were brought to hospitals here.</p>
<p>"Just tell them that the whitecaps shot me," Sheriff Bob Buchanan said. To newspaper men while sitting on the edge of a cot at a local hospital waiting to have his wound dressed.</p>
<p>"I begged and I pleaded with them" he said, "but they would not hear me"</p>
<p>Sheriff Buchanan&apos;s wounds appeared to consist of a ball which penetrated under the right armpit and a grazed wound across the right thigh. In answer to a question from Jailer Chapline as to whether he had spit any blood he replied in a firm negative.</p>

<p"Did the Klansmen charge you" Sheriff Buchanan was asked.</p>
<p>Sheriff Buchanan looked confused.  "It started --- ", he said vaguely. "I begged and pleaded," he said. It was plain he was too weak from excitement and loss of blood to continue.</p>
<p>Waco parties returning from Lorena late tonight said the trouble began when an officer seized the American flag and the man carrying it, at the head of the parade. The man carrying the flag was unmasked, and some of the others at the head of the parade were not masked. The flag was recovered by men in line and it was carried in the procession. Louis Crow of Waco, one of the men wounded, was not in the parade, being one of the spectators who went from Waco, several thousand from here going to Lorena to witness the Ku Klux parade.</p>
<p>Carl West of Lorena, who was shot in the neck, was brought here tonight for treatment, and another man whose name has not yet been learned. Will Lawson of Lorena who was slightly cut on the neck was not brought to Waco.</p>
<p>The trouble at Lorena Saturday night started after Sheriff Buchanan had repeatedly declared that the parade should not take place in that community. It was thought at first that his edict would prove effective, but this was dispelled when someone in the vast assemblage gathered in the main street of Lorena raised the cry. "The klans are coming."</p>
<p>The first section of the parade reached the business section of the town with practically unbroken ranks, save for the disturbance that occurred when Sheriff Buchanan seized the man who carried the flag, and if the advance guard heard the shooting in the rear, they continued marching. It was not until after the klansmen in the first section had been notified that their column had been broken that they disbanded, some of them immediately removing their robes and masks. </p>

<h3>CHRISTIAN O. BRONSTAD</h3>
<p> Mr. Christian O. Bronstad was born at Romedal, Hedemarken, Norway, August 20th, 1853. His parents were Ole and Christine Bronstad. He attended the school of his native parish and having received the necessary instruction in the Word of God he was confirmed in this baptismal covenant.</p>
<p>During his teens, Christian heard glowing tales of America, the land of opportunity, of prosperity and freedom and of the bright things awaiting a young man there. Thus this young man’s mind was soon settled oncoming to America. So when Mr. Hendrick Dahl visited back in Norway after having been in America, young Christian fell in line with many others, with Mr. Dahl as escort bid his native land, his friends and all his relatives a fond farewell and turned toward America to seek his fortune. The party on leaving Norway set Bosque County, Texas, as their destination. In the first part of November, 1872, Christian Bronstad, the young emigrant, left Norway. In Bordeaux, France the party was held up three days. In Liverpool another delay, this time of eleven days, held them up. From Liverpool the ship Louisiana of the State Line was boarded. About a month was spent on the Atlantic, and for three days all passengers were shut up on account of the storms. Finally in December 19, 1872 this immigrant at the age of 18, arrived in Waco, Texas.: So reads part of the biography read at the Golden Wedding of Mr. And Mrs. Christian O. Bronstad on March 1, 1927.</p>
<p>Mr. Bronstad was employed about two years in the saw mills and flour mills in Valley Mills. Then he took up his duties at the mill at Norway Mills on Neill’s Creek. Meantime his brother, Gulbrand, had joined him; his parents and others of the family coming to America still later.</p>
<p>On march 1, 1877, Mr. Bronstad was united in marriage to Martha Colwick. It was a double wedding the other couple being Dr. O. M. Olson and Margaret Colwick. The Rev. Ole Estren performed the ceremony.</p>
<p>For about two and a half years after this double wedding the ;young miller and his bride lived at Norway Mills. Leaving the ;mill they lived for a short while on the Colwick farm. In January, 1881, they moved to a newly acquired farm in the Harmony community. Mr. Bronstad was a faithful ;member of Our savior’s Lutheran Church of Norse for nearly fifty years. He was a community worker; worked for better schools, better roads, and has been active in promoting and supporting Clifton College.</p>
<p>Then years ago Mr. And Mrs. Bronstad moved to Clifton where they have resided since. On March 1, 1927 occurred the Golden Wedding of Mr. And Mrs. Christian O. Bronstad and Dr. and Mrs O. M. Olson and the Silver Wedding of Mr. And Mrs. C. A. Brown. Multitudes of friends and neighbors from Clifton and the entire community came to rejoice and bring their friendly greetings to the honored couples in the Bronstad home where the Golden Wedding was held.</p>
<p>A family of twelve__five girls and seven boys, and one grandson have been reared buy Mr. and Mrs. C. O. Bronstad. We can well understand what a source of joy it must have been to Mr. And Mrs. C. O. Bronstad on that memorable occasion of their Golden Wedding to have all their children with them and receive their testimony of love and esteem.</p>
<p>Mr. Bronstad was a faithful member of the Trinity Lutheran Church since his moving to Clifton. He was seen in his usual place at church both at the morning and night services the last Sunday he lived.</p>
<p>That necessary institution in every Christian home: the family altar or family devotion, was kept up by him. Much comfort, guidance and strength was no doubt received in this way during his life. â€œLet the World of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom.: Family devotion anchors the soul, so that it will not very readily drift from God. It draws down upon the domestic circle the blessing of God. We have the assurance that where two or three are gathered in Christ’s name, He will be with them.</p>
<p>Mr. Bronstad understood for some time that the remaining years allotted to him were most likely to be few. But the thought of departing from this life did not annoy or perplex him. He had peace with god. â€œJustified by faith, we have peace with God through our lord Jesus Christ. that was his comfort.</p>
<p>Death came at 10:30, Saturday night, January 20th. Thus, one of God’s noblemen had finished his course,</p>
<p>His passing is a loss to the community. In his friendly and Christian way he wielded a great influence for good. Men who stand like he did on the side of the right and good, who support those institutions which make for true happiness, they are the leaven on society.</p>
<p>Men who can be trusted and relied upon, and who walk among us as examples of civic and Christian virtues, they exalt righteousness, and are an honor to their community.</p>
<p>For him who has passed from our midst, to die was gain,that is our Christian hope.</p>
<p>Funeral services were conducted at the home and at the Trinity Lutheran Church on Monday afternoon at 1:30 with interment in the Trinity Lutheran cemetery, Clifton, Rev. O. T. Boe assisted by Rev. P. E. Thorson and Prof. C. Tyssen, who spoke on behalf of Clifton College, officiated. . . .</p>
<p>He leaves to mourn his departure his wife and the following children: Mrs. C. A. Brown, Miss Millie Bronstad, C.G. Bronstad, J. M. Bronstad, A. L. Bronstad and Mrs. J. M. Huse, all of Clifton; O. K. Bronstad of Fort Worth; M. T. Bronstad of Denison; C. S. Bronstad of Caddo; Mrs. Frank E. Smith of Waco; O. A. Bronstad of Coolidge; and the grandson, Leroy e. Bronstad of Ft. Worth. A daughter, Miss May Bronstad, preceded him in death on August 23, 1930. He also leaves the following sisters and brothers: Mes. Andrea Nelson, Miss Syverine Bronstad, Miss Carrie Bronstad, and Otto Bronstad, all of Waco; G. O. Bronstad of Cranfills gap; Mrs. Pernilla Anderson of near Clifton. Also 17 grandchildren and 5 great grandchildren. He also leaves a large number of other kin and a large circle of friends.</p>

<h4>Cpl. G. O. Bronstad Writes on Arab Customs in North Africa</h4>
<p> Relatives in Clifton have received the following letter from Cpl G. O. Bronstad, stationed somewhere in North Africa, and parts of it are reprinted below:</p>
<P>"Some time ago on my afternoon off while roaming around I ran into some Arabs threshing wheat which was very interesting to me as I had heard about it many times but never had the opportunity to see it. Wheat is one of the main crops here although they do not raise a great deal but what I have seen has been fairly good grade. From the best information I can obtain it seems as they made between 30 to 40 bushels to the acre which is about an average year. In many of the larger places here they have reapers of the same make as we have in the States. The threshing I was was done by hand. The Arabs would first cut the wheat by hand and then pile it into large stacks to dry for a few days. There is not much danger of rain since it hardly ever rains here at this time of the year. After it has dried thoroughly they take three horses and walk them around in the pile for about five or ten minutes. Then several Arabs walk into the pile and gather up the straw and let the wind blow through it a few times and then piled all the straw into another stack. They go through this procedure three times and Arabs with sacks or a reasonable facsimile gather this wheat from the ground what what I mean they really get every grain. The straw is then carried home for feeding purposes. You probably think the wheat is dirty after picking it from the ground, well it is, but they are not through with it. The way I have seen them clean it is on the same order as we sift sand but they do get it comparatively clean considering the way they have to clean it. Now the larger farms have reapers as I have mentioned before and how they use them on some of these wheat fields along the hill side is beyond me. Labor is very cheap over here, that is Arabs, as they can be hired for only a few francs a day. A franc is equivalent to two cents.</p>
<P>I also ran across some Arabs shelling corn. This consists of several Arabs around a large pile of corn shucking it by hand. It is then carried over to a place where two Arabs are taking their turns with the crank on the hand sheller which is American made. Now I am sure they have some modern corn shellers here some place as there is plenty of American machinery here including tractors and such.</p>
<P>Last week on my day off, I again journeyed out and attempted to visit the flour mill but didn't have any luck as usual. I did get to see their Bran which is a very poor grade of feed. Their best grade of flour is very coarse but fairly white considering everything. I did look in on the Roll floor and above each roll stand they have a large glass cylinder which the flour runs through before it hits the rolls. Don't know just how many stands they have but it looked like quite a few. I still have hopes of going through it one of these days. On my way back I came across what looked like a large market square which consisted of mostly wheat along with some Corn, Oats, Barley and different kinds of beans. Most of the grain was very clean as it had either been hand picked or cleaned with a hand machine. I saw several Arabs (mostly women) cleaning the wheat by hand moving each grain and picking out the rocks and trash. Very slow cleaning but I suppose they have plenty of time. Some of the wheat, I believe I would be safe in saying, was at least half inch long and seemed to be very heavy. This wheat is very hard and looks very much like what we call Spring Wheat. The corn is a yellow corn but it is small and practically round</p>
<P>We have had a couple of swell feeds lately. Last night we had fried chicken, potato salad, cream corn, vegetable salad, pineapple cream pie and beer or iced tea. They are really truing their best to keep us from going hungry and doing a very good job of it."</p>

<h4>Clifton Record, 1941-05-02</h4> 
<p>Cranfills  Gap suffered the most serious fire loss in the business district this past week and has retarded the forward movement of this town for some time to come. A blaze of undetermined origin at about 10 o&rsquo;clock Tuesday evening, April 22, put the Anderson Food Store out of commission.  </p> 
<p>Mr. Anderson has almost suffered a nervous breakdown, but he is a man of much courage and will soon be about some kind of business, but he is undecided yet what he will do. The building was owned by Mr. Otto Reesing but Mr. Anderson had been operating a successful food store there for a little more than a year.</p> 
<p>The devastating fire in the store apparently started in the back of the building but soon spread to the front of the one-story structure. Help was called from Meridian and the fire fighters did a mighty fine job in extinguishing the fire in record time, and in saving the Helm Grocery, Wiley&rsquo;s café and Grimland&rsquo;s hardware store. The stillness of the night was a great help in stopping the rampage of the fire. Building and contents were partly covered by insurance.</p>

<h3>NON-WAR WORKERS PARASITES SAYS F.R. MUST LEAVE CAPITAL  </h3>
<p>WASHINGTON, Jan. 30.--President Roosevelt used blunt language Friday in warning individuals he described as parasites, persons living here only for social reasons, to move out of the national capital to make room for war workers who are arriving at the rate of 1,000 a week.</p>

<p>The press conference statement may or may not have sent shivers down the spines of socialites who can claim no war connection. But one thing was certain--it did bring relief to thousands of long-time natives who read morning headlines that they may be forced to leave the city if not engaged in essential wartime activities. . .</p>

<h4>Poage Deplores Yankee Interference With Racial Problems Of The South </h4>
<p>The Special Committee which was appointed to investigate guayule as a source of domestic rubber spent the Easter Recess visiting the areas where this shrub grows-Southwest Texas and California. Ia am Chairman of the committee. We are all convinced that if necessary the United States could grow all the rubber we need from guayule. We do not know, however whether it can be produced cheaply enough to compete with "tree rubber" and synthetic rubber. . . .</p>

<p>While I did not have an opportunity at Easter to visit at home as many members did, and as I should have liked to do, I am sure that our people are disturbed over the action of the Supreme Court in holding that the Democratic Party cannot decide for itself whom it will admit to its primaries. I think each party should have the absolute right to exclude any person it wants to for any reason that seems good to the party. Of course, I cannot approve of the continued interference with our racial problem by Yankee reformers, whether the be Supreme Court Judges, C. I. O. agitators, or the President's wife. I think that since the negro was first brought to our shores by Yankee slave traders that the Southern people have done a very good job of handling the race problem. I think we are doing a much better Job of it today than the big northern cities are doing. I think that the present interference with Southern social problems can only result in tragedy and grief, particularly for the negro, and this is true even though the fault lies primarily with the Northern agitators and not with our southern Negroes. If these people would only tend to their own business and let us tend to ours we would get along with the negro to the best interest of both races . . . </p>
<blockquote class="gwb">Pogue seems comfortable explaining the bigotry most of his constituents felt. Clearly if Negroes were admitted to the Democratic party, they might gain a political voice and become harder to control.
<br><br>
To the conformist, complacent mind, it is all the fault of the Northern agitators, but note the thuggish implication that social discord . . "can only result in tragedy and grief, particularly for the negro". As the brutal beating of Shillady 25 years prior in Waco, shows, these whites–in–power were ready to become thugs even if it meant laundering the blood stains from grandfather's white sheets.
<br><br>
Many must anticipate a reprise of the heightened interracial tensions post WW I. Hundreds of thousands of able Afro-Americans learned how to fire an M-1, learned hand-to-hand combat. After risking their lives for their county, how many would be content to resume the back-seat, secondary services, second–class citizenship?
<br><br>
The segregationist drone of the 50's and 60's was "States Rights!" How little I realized the right the states wanted was the right to suppress a class of the state's citizenry. This became clear to me when the issue of states rights surfaces again when the complacent comfortable want to suppress lesbians, gays, bi–sexual and trans–gendered people under the banner of Defense of Marriage.

One could ask, "Who fought the economic structure that brought both Mother and Father to the assembly line?"

<h4>1951-11-02&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Tergerson Dies October 25</h4>
<p>Mrs. W. T. Tergerson nee Anne Lee, was born at Brotum, Hedemarken, Norway, April 5, 1859, of parents Borre and Lena Lee. She was baptized and confirmed in the Lutheran Church in Norway. There were in all nine children in her parental family in Norway. She came to America with her brother John, in 1878 and worked for Otto Johnson for eighteen months in payment for her ticket to America.</p>
<p>The children, who remained with their parents in Norway, all came with their parents to this country in 1883, with the exception of one daughter, Gurine, who passed away in Norway. The names of those who came with their parents are: Ole Lee, Mrs Martha Swenson, John Lee, Andres Lee,, and Mrs Martha Johnson, all of whom have passed away, and two surviving sisters Christine (Mrs. Hans Hanson) of the Cranfills Gap community, and Mrs. Nina Somrude of Clifton.</p>
<p>Mrs. Tergerson also worked for a time in the employ of S. R. Allen of Cleburne.</p>
<p>She was united in marriage with William Tellief Tergerson December 17, 1885. After their marriage they moved to the Mustang Community where they purchased a farm which they operated for 28 years.</p>
<p>Born to them were six children, all of whom remain to mourn their passing with the exception of one, William Junior, who passed away at the age of one year one two months. The other children are Alice (Mrs. Martin Bertelsen of Fort Worth and Mary (Mrs.Ferdie Hansen), Bettie (Mrs. Gunder Larson), Selma (Mrs Otis Bronstad), Alma (Mrs. P. B. Rohne), all of Cranfills Gap. There are eighteen grandchildren, and one great-great grandchild.</p>
<p>Sometime after they moved to the farm in the Mustang Community, Mrs. Tergerson and her husband made a home for her parents, caring for them in love all of their remaining days. It was on October 17,1913, that they moved to Cranfills gap, where they have since made their home.</p>
<p>In a historical statement which Mr. Tergerson wrote about themselves on march 17, 1933, he states: "The Lord has blessed us on the way of life. We firmly believe that it is by His guiding hand we have been so richly blessed. That He may guide us the remainder of our lives is our prayer."</p>
<p>About two years ago Mrs. Tergerson suffered a broken limb. She was confined to the Meridian hospital for an extended period of time, being critically ill. She recovered sufficiently to be removed to her home where the mending process continued, and to the amazement of all she was in time able to walk again. About mid and later September she became critically ill. From this illness she seemed to be making another remarkable recovery and seemed to be doing very well when on Thursday afternoon, October 25, around 4:00 o'clock she was again taken seriously ill. Sensing that she would not again recover Mrs. Tergerson called all of the children, who could reach her bedside around her and urged all to remain steadfast in christian faith that they all might be reunited in Heaven. Friday morning at about 9:30 o'clock her long uttered prayer to be taken home to her Savior was granted. She was 92 years, six months and 21 days of age at the time of her passing</p>
<p>A humble, believing, and devout Christian, Mrs. Tergerson, as long as she was able was active in the life of the Church, attending its services of worship and Communion with faithful regularity. They have continued to dwell in God's Word and prayer and have communed in private frequently. We shall miss her here on earth, but we rejoice in the eternal gain which is hers in God's grace in Christ whom she trusted to the end. . . . </p>

<h4>1952-08-15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Bronstad Dies In Waco</h4>

<p>Miss Bronstad was born in Hedemarken, Norway, on October 13, 1853. In 1876 she, together with her parents, two sisters, and a brother, immigrated to America.</p>
<p>She resided in the home of her brother and sister-in-law, the late Mr. and Mrs. C. O. Bronstad, who at that time lived in the Norse community, near Clifton. Later Miss Bronstad moved to Waco where the greater part of her life was spent in the home of her brother-in-law and sister, Mr. and Mrs. L. Nelson. It was following the death of Mrs. Otto Bronstad that she moved to this brother's home where she tried to fill a mother's place with the younger children of the family. . . .</p>

<h4>1950-06-23&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bosque County Loses 3,997 In Population </h4>
<p>The 1950 Census figure of 11,782 for Bosque County's population was released to County Judge O. A. Hardwick. . . .
<br>
This is a loss of 3,997 for the county since 1940, the last census. . . .
<br>
The figures compare with other rural counties in Texas; there has been a decided trend for a movement of the population to the city and a tendency to increase the size of the individual farm and decrease the personnel on each farm. </p>
