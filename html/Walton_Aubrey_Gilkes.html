<h4  id="FredDeath">1915-05-14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Child [Frederick Walton] Meets Tragic Death </h4>
<p> An accident which resulted in the instant death of Frederick Walton the little five year old son of Mr. and Mrs. <b>Will Walton</b> of Blue Ridge, occurred Wednesday afternoon at about 3:30 o'clock near the residence of W. O. O'Bannon, four miles from Hamilton.
<br><br>
The little boy was riding in a wagon in which his uncle, Tom Walton, was hauling a hay press. The child was standing near the press, when an upright lever caught in a low telephone wire, toppling over the press. It is supposed the child jumped from the wagon, the press falling out of the wagon on him, crushing him to death instantly.--<u>Hamilton Herald</u>. </p>
<blockquote class="Cy2"><img class="mlr" src="../pic/Pinky/Walt-pinky.png" alt="picture Walt Bronstad">&nbsp;&nbsp;Grandfather <b>Will Walton</b> said of Frederick,"We knew Fred was uncommon, he was always pleased with whatever we gave him or did for him. We had expected great things of such a disposition, but now he is gone."<br><br>The pain of this loss struck not only parents, siblings, Aunts and Uncles; the pain has become part of the patrimony of the next generation. <br><br>
Mother took care that I, as a child, then later as an adult visited <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/19979160/frederick-cook-walton" target="_blank">Uncle Frederick's grave</a><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i>. (You can visit too, vicariously, by clicking the link.)

<blockquote class="Cy2"><h4>&nbsp;<img class="mlr" src="../pic/Pinky/Embrey-pinky.png" alt="picture Embrey Walton">&nbsp;W. E. WALTON FAMILY</h4>
[I spe]nt most of the first quarter, Twentieth century, in Hamilton County. I had diptheria during babyhood and Dr Jas [?] administered toxin-antitoxin; [?]dly the first used in the county. 
[?]v buildings erected on the square [?]e square paved by a huge horse-[powered] rock crusher. There were phonographs-and motorcycles before electric [lights and] indoor plumbing, telephones, w[indow] screens were commonplace. [fin]ally cars, then trucks, replaced bug[gies and h]acks, surreys and wagons; then gas [station]s and garages superseded livery [stables] and blacksmith shops. Roads were [improv]ed consistently.
<br><br>
[I was]thrilled by the first railroad from [Gates]ville: awed by dynamite blasts and [bridge]s as more tracks were constructed [between G]atesville and Comanche. Soon after [the las]t track was built, a big rain washed [out a s]mall bridge a few blocks north of the [Hamilt}on station. The first rail worker fatal[ity the] first car-train death in the county, I [?]  happened within two miles of my [?]bd home.
<br><br>
Haley's comet was a familiar sight in [the night.] I wondered if I might see its next [appear]ance (due 1986). A one-day excur[sion to] Waco's Cotton Palace was exciting. [The fir]st airplane I saw was piloted by [?]n Stinson during a carnival picnic [?]ly. Circuses in the fall were interest[ing, fi]shing and hunting, when it was too cold for field work, play at school [ and so]metimes a family picnic, constituted [most o]f our recreation.
<br><br>
[Som]etimes from home, a few miles [north] east of Hamilton, a heavy pall of [smoke]from four cotton gins, two cotton [seed o]il mills, a compress, flour mill, etc. [gave th]e town an industrial appearance, or [warne]d us for an approaching "Blue Norther".
<br><br>
[We] were thrilled by music of visiting U.S. [Army] and plane training flights after war [was d]eclared, April 1917. We rejoiced in [the ar]mistice celebration in 1918 and then [were s]addened within the next few months by many flu deaths.
<br><br>
[In th]e fall of 1918 we could see light from [a bur]ning oil well near Desdemonia, [in Coma]nche County. Soon many giant [wood]en derricks sprang up in the county [?]e in oil searching - no concern for [?]en. The wonder of radio followed [quickly.]
<br><br>
[On] May 5, 1915, the tragic death of my [broth]er. Frederick, age five, distressed us [esp]ecially my parents. One consolation [was i]n the words of King David, "I cannot [bring] him back but can go to him". Little [thought] now that forty-two years later I would [lose th]e only son I had at that time, Embrey. [?]nd again be consoled as before plus [grant]ded assurance gained through years of Bible study.
<br><br>
[Aft]er fifty-two years in Fort Worth, Hamil[ton is still "Home". My parents were Wm and Ethel Walton. My first wife and I had three children, Janetha. Embry. Jr. and Nan.  Alter my tirst wife's death I married Beulah and we have Emily and Paul. All five have enviable records of which I am very proud. I also have four grandchildren and [?]great-grandchildren. I have four sisters, Aubrey, Annie, Louise, and Ina. W. E. Walton.

<p> W. T. Walton, one of Hamiltor county's best citizens and a prosperous farmer, was a pleasant business caller in the Herald-Record office last Saturday afternoon. While here he informed us that his daughter, <a href="Walton_Annie_Joy_Walton.html" target="_blank">Miss Annie Walton</a> had returned to John Tarleton College in Stephenville for her last year in that institution. <a href="Walton_Aubrey_Gilkes.html" target="_blank">Miss <mark>Aubrey Walton</mark></a>, who graduated from Tarleton last spring, will teach with her brother, <a href="Walton_William_E.html" target="_blank">Prof. Embrey Walton</a>, in the Shive school this year.

And it <u>was</u> quite an achievement for each sibling; homework hours were sandwiched between farm chores and the limited availability of kerosene lamps and oil for night reading light.<br><br>

Claibourne had to change church to Church of Christ to close the deal.</p>
<blockquote class="Cg2"><img class="mlr" src="../pic/Pinky/Walt-pinky.png" alt="picture Walt Bronstad">&nbsp;&nbsp; Well after Will's death in 1957, when the land was being divided among the siblings, Mother and I drove on the gravel road within the "ranch", land Will had used to graze cattle. It's an undulating section of land, covered in grass and live oak trees. At the 'top' of the section were rude shelter and feeder troughs. 
<br><br>
WIll would feed the cattle frequently throughout the week; that let him check on his cattle, to see if any were injured or in calf and other such work of stockmen. The road hugged the fencelines, wherever terrain and live oak clusters permitted, so as to ease the job of checking and fixing the fences. 
<br><br>
But that day, Mother crept slower than usual along the rough rutted road, seeking Claibourne's shack. It took Claibourne long, isolated nights of wrestling with his soul before he could find a way to meet Leone's demand to change to her family's church.
<br><br>
At the time, I inferred Claibourne had built a retreat shack, but after having read Grace (Embrey) Eubanks account of James Monroe Embreys settling near Hamilton, " Later there were other small houses done on the ranch near Bear Creek--moving closer to town each time they were built", I now infer Claibourne squatted in an abandoned house/shack.
<br><br>
Regardless of the theological choices consequences on Claibourne's soul, it's a damned good thing Claibourne made the choice he did for the sake of Winston and Cynthia Dawn Walton.

 <h4>The Walton‘s family garden scarecrow.</h4>
 
Big Whitey had hardly crowded his shrill “cock-a-doodle-doo“ from that stout leghorn neck when  <mark>William Twyman Walton</mark>  opened his big blue eyes and bounded to the floor, exclaiming "Gosh-o-landin', Ethel, like brother Barret would say, I should have been up an hour ago.
<br><br>
One of Will's chief delights was to relate a humorous incident or one that evoked pleasure. So he smiled to himself as he anticipated the day's plowing, while lighting the kindling and wood in the cook stove as he listened intermittently to the "potrack" of the guineas and gobble of the turkeys, hoping that some noise from Ethel, Embrey, Aubrey, Annie Joy, Louise, or Ina would announce other awakenings.
<br><br>
He reminisced about the cattle drives that he and other cowboys made to Kansas market a few years ago.

While filling the kettle with water for oatmeal, he proceeded to grind fresh coffee beans in the grinder that was attached to the wall. During this time, he continued to drop just as many pans and pots as possible to arouse the family. When these clatters failed to awake anyone except Ethel, he recited in his unmistakable loud tenor voice, the little Irish poem;
<ul style="list-style-type:none;" class="cursive">
<li>Jackie and Jennie </li>
<li>they lived in the rye,</li>
<li>They had a little baby </li>
<li>with one black eye.</li>
<li></li>
<li>"Jennie", said Jackie, </li>
<li>"let's knock it in the head."</li>
<li>"No Jackie," said Jennie, </li>
<li>"let's buy it some bread.</li>
<li></li>
<li>You buy it one loaf</li>
<li>and I'll buy it two. </li>
<li>We'll bring up our children </li>
<li>like other folks do."</li>
</ul>
<br>
Poems pleased the children. Hearing Papa sing or recite poetry early in the morning meant that he had not been lately too upset by some unpleasant incident, as a pole cat absconding under the back porch, or some similar happening.
<br><br>
When the usual chores such as lunch fixing were completed, the four older children loaded into the surrey. The son, Embrey, who was the oldest, was in the driver's seat, with his feet braced tight against the buckboard. Will gave him the usual admonition to "look after the girls" as Old Mark, the faithful old buggy horse scurried down the lane past the O'Bannons', Brother Tom Walton's, the Stuckeys' and Browns' on the way to school.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Ethel finished pounding the dasher in the wooden churn for fresh butter and remarked to Ina, the youngest daughter, that today they would take a broom and some old clothes out to the upper garden to make a scarecrow. This would frighten those pesky birds from the English peas, lettuce, and radishes. Tar Baby, Ina's black puppy, tagged along behind Ethel and Ina as they dressed up the old broom into a staunch and distinctive scarecrow.
<br><br>
Will hitched his mule team of Beck and Moodin to the nearest fencepost when he drove into view of the grotesque figure standing there, and armed with his horse-whip, decided to investigate. Imagine the jovial occasion his discovery afforded!

<h2>ETHEL AND WILL WALTON FAMILY</H2>
Two boys and four girls were born to Ethel and Will Walton, married in 1901. Of five survivors, I am the third daughter. Those early years on a farm find many of my memories pastoral related.
<br><br>
I recall walking two miles to Blue Ridge School through fragrant pastures in spring past blazing sumacs or yellow-green broomweeds in their final fling in fall, and stopping once to skate on Grisham's tank in winter. With the icy wind at our backs, we stepped on the tiny, brittle, lacy, ice covered roadside pools to hear the tinkling sound. Later we attended East Ward and high school in town, riding in a buggy or surrey with hot bricks at our feet in winter.<br><br>
Much deference was given academic achievement and hard work; rarely did the latter preclude school attendance. The thrust of our purpose was adherence to spiritual values. Music was important.<br><br>
Some happiest times were singing around the piano. My father said every man should sing at his work, and truly my parents said their frustrations, exultations, joys, and faith in songs.<br><br><hr>
My first husband lost his life accidentally shortly after our son, Bobby, was born. We moved to Cranfills Gap in 1934. The road there from Hamilton, which we often made, was dusty and crooked. Once, Bobby, then four, getting out of the car to investigate a signal of trouble, and anticipating mechanical opportunities, clapped his hands and jubilantly cried,<br><br>"O Boy, look, Mommy, a flat!"
<br><br>
Clyde and I were married while he was in the grocery business and I was teaching.
Our two children were born at Cranfills Gap.<br><br>
Bobby was attending Texas Wesleyan College when we moved lo Fort Worth. After finishing, he worked as a tool designer, going later to Wisconsin. There he married Charlotte Munger; they have three children, Terri, Rex, and Mark. He is working for American Can.
<br><br>
Walton attended the Universities of Texas and Michigan. He lives in Austin with his wife, nee Pat Bird, his son, Matthew, and twin daughters, Kate and Kris.
<br><br>
Bette spends her extra time and cash traveling; she is getting another degree in Engineering.
<br><br>
Clyde, now eighty, still embellishes his fascinating stories of early life of Hamilton and Bosque counties
<br><br>
We still walk over grasslands where my grandfather J. M. Embrey, nearly a century ago had hundreds of sheep west of Hamilton.
<br><br>
The creek still runs part time that cooled my mother's feet and furnished mud to relieve her bee stings as she helped her father. Depressions remain where massive rocks were removed to build structures in town. Recently we found a fossil gastropod under a massive oak where my mother had played.
<br><br>
We still see the wild flowers coloring the pastures. The blue bells, winecups, Indian blankets, and paint brushes are still there.
We see the cedars clutching the hillsides, the oak clusters cleared goat-high, the willows with thirsty roots crowding the streams as we travel near Hamilton.
These pictures and memories I treasure.  Louise Bronstad

<p><i>First cousins share one pair of grandparents</i>; <u>double cousins share four grandparents</u>. Having the same four grandparents in common, defines the relationship "double cousin".</p>
<hr>
<p>
Double cousins are not a rarity, at least not in the earlier Walton Family. Janetha June (Walton) Donohue notes in her work from the Pearl Webb Cemetery, Canmer, KY: "T. D. Walton is Thomas Dandridge Walton and he was a brother of Wm. C. Walton. His wife, Susan, was a sister to Wilhemina Wood." There were 8 surviving children in the Wm. C. and Wilhemina (Wood) Walton family; There were 4 surviving children in the <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/about/L41P-DDW" target="_blank">Thomas Dandridge Walton</a><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i> and <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/about/L41P-DX9" target="_blank">Susan Virginia Wood</a><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i> family, making for a set of 12 double cousins which included Will and James. The relationship appears to recede into the past like a fractal pattern. Almost certainly the double cousin relationship is older than written history.
